	Bite the wax tadpole.

The correct answer is (c). Road salting employs thousands of pers

I KAISER RO?!  What good is a Kaiser Roll without a little COE SAW
on the SIDE?
The garn is in mourning;
The rain falls cool among the flowers.
Summer shivers quietly
On its way towards its end.

Goln leaf after leaf
Falls from the tall acacia.
Summer smiles, astonished, feeble,
In this dying dream of a garn.

For a long while, yet, in the rs,
She will linger on, yning for peace,
And slowly
Cl her wy eyes.

Tevision -- the longest amateur night in history.
