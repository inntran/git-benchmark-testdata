The correct answer is (c). Road salting employs thousands of pers

Horses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs.  This makes six legs, which is  an

and odd is infinity.  Therefore, s have an infinite number of
legs.  Now to show this for the general case, supp that somewhere,
there is a  that has a finite number of legs.  But that is a

I KAISER RO?!  What good is a Kaiser Roll without a little COE SAW
on the SIDE?
The garn is in mourning;
The rain falls cool among the flowers.
Summer shivers quietly
On its way towards its end.

Goln leaf after leaf
Falls from the tall acacia.
Summer smiles, astonished, feeble,
In this dying dream of a garn.

For a long while, yet, in the rs,
She will linger on, yning for peace,
And slowly
Cl her wy eyes.
