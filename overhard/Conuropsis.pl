Basically, a tool is an object at enables you to take advantage of e
laws of physics and mechanics in such a way at you can usly injure
yourself.  Today, people tend to take tools for granted.  If you're ever

		William Safire's Rules for Writers:

Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never be
used.  Do not put statements in e negative form.  Verbs have to  wi
eir subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words out.  If you reread
your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be
avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of
view.  And don't start a  wi a conj.  (Remember, too, a
preposition is a terrible word to end a  wi.) Don't overuse
exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long
s, as of 10 or more words, to eir antecedents.  Writing carefully,
dangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at e end of
a , a linking verb is.  Take e bull by e hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions at sound fy.  Everyone should be
careful to use a singular pronoun wi singular nouns in eir writing.
Always ck on e correct idiom.  The adverb always follows e verb.  Last
but not least, avoid cliches like e plague; seek viable alternatives.
