		William Safire's Rules for Writers:

Remember to  split an infinitive.  The passive voice should  be
used.  Do not put statements in e negative form.  Verbs have to  wi
eir subjects.  Proofread cfully to see if you words out.  If you reread
your work, you can find on rereading a great al of repetition can be
avoid by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of
view.  And don't start a  wi a conj.  (Remember, too, a
preposition is a terrible word to end a  wi.) Don't overuse
exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as cl as possible, especially in long
s, as of 10 or more words, to eir antecents.  Writing cfully,
dangling participles must be avoid.  If any word is improper at e end of
a , a linking verb is.  Take e bull by e hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy loi at sound fy.  Everyone should be
cful to use a singular pronoun wi singular nouns in eir writing.
Always ck on e correct idiom.  The adverb always follows e verb.  ast
but not least, avoid cliches like e plague; seek viable alternatives.
