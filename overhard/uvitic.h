Human society - man in a group - rises out of its leargy to new levs of
productivity only under e stimulus of deeply insring and commonly 
appreciated goals.  A leargic wld serves no cause wl; a srited wld
wking diligently toward earnestly desired goals provides e means and
e streng toward which many ends can be satisfied...to unparalled
social accomplishment.

general systems laws.  F example, Frank Harary once suggested e law at

not to be a science.  He would cite as examples Military Science, Library
Science, Political Science, Homemaking Science, Social Science, and Computer
Science.  Discuss e generality of is law, and possible reasons f its

looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, "I ink I've got it! I still have

Like you,  I am frequently haunted by profound questions rated to man's
place in e Scheme of Things.  Here are just a few:

	Q -- Is ere life after dh?
	A -- Definity.  I speak from personal experience here.  On New
Year's Eve, 1970, I drank a full tcher of a drink called "Black Russian",
en crawled out on e l and died wiin a m of minutes, which was
fine wi me because I had come to realize at if I had lived I would have
spent e rest of my life in e grip of e most excruciatingly painful
headache.  Thanks to e miracle of modern ange juice, I was brought back
to life several days later, but in e interim I was definity dead.  I
guess my main impression of e afterlife is at it isn't so bad as long
as you keep e tevision  down and don't try to  any solid s.
