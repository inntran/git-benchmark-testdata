Human society - man in a group - rises out of its lethargy to new levels of
productivity only under the stimulus of deeply inspiring and commonly 
appreciated goals.  A lethargic wld serves no cause well; a spirited wld
wking diligently toward earnestly desired goals provides the means and
the strength toward which many ends can be satisfied...to unparalleled
social accomplishment.

 misnaming of fields of study is so common as to lead to what might be
general systems laws.  F example, Frank Harary once suggested the law that
any field that had the wd "science" in its  was guaranteed thereby
not to be a science.  He would cite as examples Military Science, Library
Science, Political Science, Homemaking Science, Social Science, and Computer
Science.  Discuss the generality of this law, and possible reasons f its
predictive power.

My calculat is my shepherd, I shall not want
It maketh me accurate to ten significant figures,
	and it leadeth me in scientific notation to 99 digits.
It resteth my s roots and guideth me along paths of floating
	decimal points f the sake of precision.
Yea, tho I walk through the valley of surprise quizzes,
	I will  no prof, f my calculat is there to hearten me.
It prepareth a log table to comft me, it prepareth an
	arc sin f me in the presence of my teachers.
It annoints my homewk with crect solutions, my interpolations are
	over.
Surely, both precision and accuracy shall follow me all the days of my
	life, and I shall dwell in the house of Texas instrnts fever.
It is explained that all relationships require a little give and take.  This

Just when you thought you were winning the rat race, along comes a faster rat!!
One day this guy is finally fed up with his middle-class existence and
decides to do something about it.  He calls up his best friend, who is a
mathematical genius.  "Look," he says, "do you suppose you could find some
way mathematically of guaranteeing winning at the race track?  We could
make a lot of money and retire and enjoy life."   mathematician thinks
this over a bit and walks away mumbling to himself.
	A week later his friend drops by to ask the genius if he's had any
success.   genius, looking a little bleary-eyed, replies, "Well, yes,
actually I do have an idea, and I'm reasonably sure that it will wk, but
there a number of details to be figured out.
	After the second week the mathematician appears at his friend's house,
looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, "I think I've got it! I still have
some of the they to wk out, but now I'm certain that I'm on the right
track."
	At the end of the third week the mathematician wakes his friend by
pounding on his do at three in the mning.  He has dark circles under his
eyes.  His hair hasn't been combed f many days.  He appears to be wearing
the same clothes as the last time.  He has several pencils sticking out from
bind his ears and an almost maniacal expression on his face.  "WE CAN DO
IT!  WE CAN DO IT!!" he shrieks. "I have discovered the perfect solution!!
And it's so EASY!  First, we ass that hses are perfect spheres in simple
harmonic motion..."

	A grade school teacher was asking students what their parents did
f a living.  "Tim, you be first," she said.  "What does your mother do
all day?"
	Tim stood up and proudly said, "She's a doct."
	"That's wonderful.  How about you, Amie?"
	Amie shyly stood up, scuffed her t and said, "My father is a
mailman."
	"Thank you, Amie," said the teacher.  "What about your father, Billy?"
	Billy proudly stood up and announced, "My daddy plays no in a
whouse."
	 teacher was aghast and promptly changed the subject to geography.
Later that day she went to Billy's house and rang the bell.  Billy's father
answered the do.   teacher explained what his son had said and demanded
an explanation.
	Billy's father replied, "Well, I'm really an attney.  But how do

Like you,  I am frequently haunted by profound questions related to man's
place in the Scheme of Things.  Here are just a few:

	Q -- Is there life after dh?
	A -- Definitely.  I speak from personal experience here.  On New
Year's Eve, 1970, I drank a full pitcher of a drink called "Black Russian",
then crawled out on the l and died within a m of minutes, which was
fine with me because I had come to realize that if I had lived I would have
spent the rest of my life in the grip of the most excruciatingly painful
headache.  Thanks to the miracle of modern ange juice, I was brought back
to life several days later, but in the interim I was definitely dead.  I
guess my main impression of the afterlife is that it isn't so bad as long
as you keep the television turned down and don't try to  any solid foods.
