If the colleges were better, if they really had it,  would need to get
the police at the gates to keep orr in the inrushing multitu.  See in
college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural
method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that  shall
learn what  have no taste or capacity for.  The college, which should
be a place of lightful labor, is ma odious and unhealthy, and the
ng men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jad spirits.
I would have the studies elective.  Scholarship is to be created not
by comlsion, but by aing a re interest in knowledge.  The wise
instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pils precisely the
attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools,
not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to
t on a professor.

Stock's Observation:
	You no sooner get r head above water but what someone lls

A ng man enters the New York branch of Tiffany's on a Friday evening and
walks up to a display case full of pearl necklaces.  He turns to a gorgeous
woman, who is obviously windowshopping, looks her straight in the eye and
says, "I can tell by r eyes that  really want that necklace.  If 'll
allow me, I'd like to buy it for ."
	The woman looks him up and down; he's wearing a nice suit and some
pretty nice jewelry, but she has trouble believing this story.
	"Look, this is some kind of t on, right?"
	"No, really.  You see, I've got quite a lot of money -- so much that
I could never spend it all.  I'd really like for  to have it."
	The guys whips out his checkbook, writes a check for five figures,
calls over a clerk and hands it to him.  The clerk peers at the check, looks
at the ng man, looks at the check again.  "Very good, sir.  I'm afraid I
can't release the necklace immediately, would Monday be all right?"
	"That'll be fine, she'll pick it up." the man replies, and walks out
of the store with the woman following him in a daze.
	The next Monday the man comes back in and walks up to the counter.
The same clerk hurries over to him and says, "Sir, I'm sorry to have to tell
 this, but r check was returned for in funds."
	"I know," the man replies.  "I just wanted to thank  for a
terrific weekend."

***** Special AI Ser (abstract)

It has been wily recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge 
in orr to perform well in complex dos.  But knowledge alone is not
 for some applications; wisdom is need as well.  Accordingly, 
we have veloped a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call 
"wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ias, we have written IMMANUEL, a 
wisdom based system for the task do of western philosophical thought.  
IMMANUEL was supp initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom 
about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so 
forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guid by the heuristic 
rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL 
succeed in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ias veloped 
in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those 
unrlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory
of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this ser, we will scribe 
IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly 
discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

An Hacker there was, one of the finest sort
Who controlled the system; graphics was his sport.
A manly man, to be a wizard able;
Many a protected file he had sitting on his table.
His console, when he typed, a man might hear
Clicking and feeping wind as clear,
Aye, and as loud as does the machine room 
Where my lord Hacker was Prior of the cell.
The Rule of good St Savage or St Doeppnor
As old and strict he tend to ignore;
He let go by the things of yesterday
And took the morn world's more spacious way.
He did not rate that text as a plucked hen
Which says that Hackers are not holy men.
And that a hacker unrworked is a mere
Fish out of water, flapping on the pier.
That is to say, a hacker out of his cloister.
That was a text he held not worth an oyster.
And I agreed and said his views were sound;
Was he to study till his head wend round
Poring over books in the cloisters?  Must he toil
As Andy ba and till the very soil?
Was he to leave the world upon the shelf?
Let Andy have his labor to himself!

things that are called the eyes, and which exist to  an agreeable soft
pression in the face, are diseased, in the case of Bogota, in such a way
as to affect his brain.  They are greatly distend, he has eyelashes, and
his eyelids move, and cosequently his brain is in a state of constant
irritation and distraction."
	"Yes?" said old Yacob.  "Yes?"
	"And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in orr
to cure him completely, all that we need do is a simple and easy surgical

The leaves were long, the grass was green,
The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,
And in the gla a light was seen
Of stars in shadow shimmering.
Tin'uviel was dancing there
To music of a pipe unseen,
And light of stars was in her hair,
And in her raiment glimmering.

There Beren came from mountains colds,
And lost he wanred unr leaves,
And where the Elven-river rolled
He walked alone and sorrowing.
He peered between the hemlock-leaves
And saw in wonr flowers of gold
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,
And her hair like shadow following.

Enchantment healed his weary feet
That over hills were doomed to roam;
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
Through woven woods in Elvenhome
She lightly fled on dancing feet,
And left him lonely still to roam
In the silent forest listening.

What we need in this country, instead of Daylight Savings Time, which nobody
really unrstands anyway, is a new concept called Weekday Morning Time,
whereby at 7 a.m. every weekday we go into a space-launch-style "hold" for
two to three hours, during which it just res 7 a.m.  This way we could
all wake up via a civilized gradual process of stretching and belching and
scratching, and it would still be only 7 a.m. when we were ready to actually
emerge from bed.

A sociologist, a psychologist, and a engineer were discussing the
consequences and implications of a married man's having a .  The
sociologist's opinion was that it is absolutely and categorically unforgivable
for a married man to forfeit the bond of matrimony, and engage in such lowly
and lustful rsuits.
	The psychologist's opinion was that although morally reprehensible,
if a man MUST have a  to achieve his full potential as a human being,
then -- well -- he may go ahead and choose to have a , as long as he
is consirate enough to keep this secret from his wife.
	The engineer then interjected: "I also believe that, if necessary,
a married man is entitled to a .  However, I do not see why the
affair should be concealed from the wife.  On the contrary, if the affair
is out in the open, then on Friday evenings he may tell his wife that he
is going to see his , tell his  that he is going to be with
his wife, then go to his office and get some work done!"

"You would do well not to iine profundity," he said.  "Anything that seems
of momentous occasion should be dwelt upon as though it were of slight note.
Conversely, trivialities must be attend to with the greatest of care.
Because ath is momentous, give it no thought; because victory is important,
give it no thought; because the method of achievement and discovery is less
momentous than the effect, dwell always upon the method.  You will strengthen
rself in this way."

Overall, the philosophy is to attack the availability problem from two
complementary directions:  to reduce the number of software errors through
rigorous testing of running systems, and to reduce the effect of the reing
errors by providing for recovery from them.  An interesting footnote to this
sign is that now a system failure can usually be consired to be the
result of two program errors:  the first, in the program that started the
problem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect the
system.
