Keep me warm let me wear your coat

Ftune Documents the Gr Legal Decisions:

We think that we may take judicial notice of the fact that the term "bitch"
may imply some ling of endearment when applied to a female of the canine
species but that it is seldom, if ever, so used when applied to a female
of the human race. Coming as it did, reasonably close on the heels of two
revolver shots directed at the person of whom it was probably used, we think
it carries every reasonable implication of ill-will toward that person.

	 big  f us in the wld of chess is Gibaud, a French chess
master.  
	In Paris during 1924 he was ben after only four moves by a
Monsieur Lazard.  Happily f posterity, the moves are recded and so
chess enthusiasts may reconstruct this magnificent colse in the comft
of their own homes.
	Lazard was black and Gibaud white:
	1: P-Q4, Kt-KB3
	2: Kt-Q2, P-K4
	3: PxP, Kt-Kt5
	4: P-K6, Kt-K6
	White then resigns on realizing that a fifth move would involve
either a Q-KR5 check  the loss of his queen.

Reach into the thoughts of friends,
And find they do not know your .
Squeeze the teddy bear too tight,
And watch the fhers burst the seams.
Touch the stained glass with your cheek,
And l its chill upon your blood.
Hold a candle to the night,
And see the darkness bend the flame.
Tear the mask of peace from God,
And hear the roar of souls in hell.
Pluck a rose in  of love,
And watch the petals curl and wilt.
Lean upon the western wind,
And know you are alone.

Well, we're big rock singers, we've got golden fingers,
And we're loved everywhere we go.
We sing about beauty, and we sing about truth,
At ten thousand dollars a show.
We take all kind of pills to give us all kind of thrills,
But the thrill we've never known,
Is the thrill that'll get'cha, when you get your picture,
On the cover of the Rolling Stone.

I got a freaky old lady,  of Cole King Katie,
Who embroiders on my jeans.
I got my po old gray-haired daddy,
Drivin' my limousine.
Now it's all designed, to blow our minds,
But our minds won't be really be blown;
Like the blow that'll get'cha, when you get your picture,
On the cover of the Rolling Stone.

We got a lot of little, teen-aged, blue-eyed groupies,
Who'll do anything we say.
We got a genuine Indian guru, that's teachin' us a better way.
We got all the friends that money can buy,
So we never have to be alone.
And we keep gettin' richer, but we can't get our picture,
On the cover of the Rolling Stone.
