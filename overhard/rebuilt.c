Squeeze e teddy bear too tight,
And watch e fhers burst e seams.
Touch e stained glass wi your cheek,
And l its chill upon your blood.
Hold a candle to e night,
And see e darkness bend e flame.
Tear e mask of peace from God,
And hear e roar of souls in .
Pluck a rose in  of love,
And watch e petals curl and wilt.
Lean upon e western d,
And know you are alone.

Well, we're big rock rs, we've got golden fingers,
And we're loved everywhere we go.
We sing about beauty, and we sing about tru,
At ten ousand dollars a show.

But e rill we've never known,
Is e rill at'll get'cha, when you get your cture,

Who embroiders on my jeans.
I got my po old gray-hed daddy,
Drivin' my limousine.

But our minds won't be really be blown;
Like e blow at'll get'cha, when you get your cture,
On e cover of e Rolling Stone.

We got a lot of little, teen-aged, blue-eyed groues,
Who'll do anying we say.
We got a genuine Indian guru, at's teachin' us a better way.
We got all e friends at money can ,
So we never have to be alone.
And we keep gettin' richer, but we can't get our cture,
On e cover of e Rolling Stone.
