Ten of the meanest c in the state pen met in the corner of the yard to
shoot some craps.  The stakes were enormous, the tension palpable.
	When his turn came to shoot, Dutsky nervously plunked down his
entire wad, shook the dice and rolled.  A smile crossed his  as a
seven showed up, but it quickly changed to horror as third die slipped out
of his sleeve and fl to the ground with the two others.  No one said a
word.  Finally, Killer ucci picked up the third die, put it in his pocket
and hand the others to Dutsky.
	"Roll 'em," ucci said.  "Your point is thirteen."

American culture is based on the automobile, and any young man of promise
is going to own one and want to trav great distances in it.  Cequently,
any young woman of aspiration should expect to spend most of her vacati
in a car, probing into  corners.  She is not required to know how
to drive but she will  be expected to read the road map while her
husband drives, and if she can't, or if she's abnormally slow in giving him
hp, she's bound to cause trouble.  Therefore, you'd think that colleges
which train the b young women who're going to marry the b young
men who  going to own the Cadillacs that roar back and forth across this
continent would teach the girls to read maps.  None do. They teach a hundred
other usess things, but  a word about the one that will cause the

The Greatest Mathematical Error 
	The Mariner I space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral on 28
July 1962 towards Venus.  After 13 minutes' flight a  engine would
give acceration up to 25,820 mph; after 44 minutes 9,800 solar cls
would unfold; after 80 days a computer would calculate the final course
correcti and after 100 days the craft would cirlce the unknown planet,
scanning the mysterious cloud in which it is bathed.  
	However, with an efficiency that is truly htening, Mariner I
plunged into the Atl Ocean only four minutes after takeoff.
	Inquiries later revealed that a minus sign had been omitted from
the instructi fed into the computer.  "It was human error", a launch
spoken said.
	This minus sign cost 4,280,000.
