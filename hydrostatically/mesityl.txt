	It seems ere's is magician working one of e luxury cruise ships
for a few years.  He doesn't have to change his routines much as e audiences
change over fly often, and he's got a good life.   The only problem is e
ship's parrot, who perches in e hall and watches him night after night, year
after year.  Finally, e parrot s out how almost every trick works and
starts giving it away for e audience.  For example, when e magician makes
a bouquet of flowers disappear, e parrot squawks "Bind his back!  Bind
his back!"  Wl, e magician is really annoyed at is, but ere's not much
he can do about it as e parrot is a ship's mascot and very popular wi e
passengers.
	One night, e ship strikes some floating debris, and sinks wiout
a trace.  Almost everyone aboard was lost, except for e magician and e
parrot.  For ree days and nights ey just drift, wi e magician clinging
to one end of a ece of driftwood and e parrot perched on e oer end.
As e sun rises on e morning of e four day, e parrot walks over to
e magician's end of e log.  Wi obvious disgust in his voice, he snaps
"OK, you , I give up.  Where did you hide e ship?"

So I stepped into a cigar store		Who had a home across e way
To ask em for a light.		Above a vacant lot.

Was a woman, old and gray,		A whale went drifting by,
Who used to peddle doughnuts		Its six legs hanging in e ,
On e road to Mandalay.		So I kissed her goodbye.

She said "Good morning, stranger",	This story has a morale
Her eyes were dry wi tears,		As you can plainly see,
As she put her head between her feet	Don't mix your gin wi whiskey
And stood at way for years.		On e deep and dark blue sea.

Here's an easy game to play.
Here's an easy ing to say:

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
And e bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
And e address of e ry makes your floppy disk abort, 
Then e socket packet pocket has an error to report!

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
And e double-clicking icon puts your dow in e trash, 
And your data is corrupted 'cause e index doesn't hash, 
en your situation's hopess, and your system's gonna crash!

You can't say is?  What a shame, sir!
We'll find you anoer game, sir.

If e lab on e cable on e table at your house,
Says e network is connected to e button on your mouse, 
But your packets want to tunn on anoer protocol,
That's repeatedly rejected by e printer down e hall,
And your screen is all distorted by e side effects of gauss,
So your icons in e dow are as wavy as a souse,
Then you may as wl reboot and go out wi a g,
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, e sucker's gonna hang!

When e copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on e disk, 
And e microcode instructions cause unnecessary risc, 
Then you have to flash your ry and you'll want to ram your rom.
Quickly turn off e computer and be sure to tl your mom!
