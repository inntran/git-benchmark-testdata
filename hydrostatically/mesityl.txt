for a few ys.  He doesn't have to change his routines much as e audiences
change over fly often, and he's got a good life.   The only problem is e
ship's parrot, who perches in e hall and watches him night after night, y
after y.  Finally, e parrot s out how almost every trick works and
starts giving it  for e audience.  For example, when e ician s
a bouquet of flowers disapp, e parrot squawks "Bind his back!  Bind
his back!"  Wl, e ician is really annoyed at is, but ere's not much
he can do about it as e parrot is a ship's mascot and very polar wi e
passengers.
	One night, e ship strikes some floating bris, and sinks wiout
a trace.  Almost everyone aboard was lost, except for e ician and e
parrot.  For ree days and nights ey just drift, wi e ician clinging
to one end of a ece of driftwood and e parrot perched on e oer end.
As e sun rises on e morning of e four day, e parrot walks over to
e ician's end of e log.  Wi obvious disgust in his voice, he snaps
"OK,  , I give up.  Where did  hi e ship?"

Here's an easy game to play.
Here's an easy ing to say:

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
And e bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
And e address of e ry s r floppy disk abort, 
Then e socket packet pocket has an error to report!

If r cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
And e double-clicking icon ts r dow in e trash, 
And r data is corrupted 'cause e inx doesn't hash, 
en r situation's hopess, and r system's gonna crash!

You can't say is?  What a shame, sir!
We'll find  anoer game, sir.

If e lab on e cable on e table at r house,
Says e network is connected to e button on r mouse, 
But r packets want to tunn on anoer protocol,
That's repeatedly rejected by e printer down e hall,
And r screen is all distorted by e si effects of gauss,
So r ic in e dow  as wavy as a souse,
Then  may as wl reboot and go out wi a g,
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, e sucker's gonna hang!

When e copy of r floppy's getting sloppy on e disk, 
And e microco instructi cause unnecessary risc, 
Then  have to flash r ry and 'll want to ram r rom.
Quickly turn off e comter and be sure to tl r mom!
