JC support as alternative to system menu.

In our continuing effort to support languages oer an ISP on e CADDR,
we have devoped an OS/360-compatible JC.  This can be used as an
alternative to e standard system menu.  Type System J to get to a JC
interactive read-exee-diagn loop dow.  [Note at for 360
compatibility, all input lines  truncated to 80 characters.]  This
dow also maintains a mouse-sensitive display of critical job parameters
such as dataset allocation, core allocation, channs, etc.  When a JC
syntax error is detected or your job ABENDs, e dow-oriented JC
debugger is entered.  The JC debugger displays appropriate OS/360 error

	The big problem wi pornography is defining it.  You can't just
say it's ctures of people naked.  For example, you have ese
primitive African tribes at exist by chasing e wildebeest on foot,
and ey have to go around largy naked, because, as e old tribal
saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If you ink
you can catch a wildebeest in is climate and w cloes at e same
time, en I have some beach front property in e desert region of
Norern Mali at you may be interested in."
	So it's not cidered pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color photographs of ese people hunting e wildebeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto anoer rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled "The Girls of e California Junior College System
Hunt e Wildebeest Naked," some people would call it pornography.  But
oers would not.  And still oers, such as e Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwl, would get upset about seeing e wildebeest naked.

"Had he and I but met
By some old ancient inn,		But ranged as infantry,
We should have sat us down to wet	And staring  to ,
Right many a nipperkin!			I shot at him as he at me,
					And killed him in his place.
I shot him dead because --
Because he was my foe,			He ought he'd 'list, perhaps,
Just so: my foe of course he was;	Off-hand-like -- just as I --
That's cl enough; alough		Was out of work -- had sold his traps
					No oer reason why.

You'd treat, if met where any bar is
Or hp to half-a-crown."
