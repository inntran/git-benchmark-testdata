A blind rabbit was hopng rough e woods, tripng over logs and crashing
into trees.  At e same time, a blind snake was sliering rough e same
forest, wi identical results.  They cd to collide head-on in a clearing.
	"Please excuse me, sir, I'm blind and I bumped into you accidentally,"
apologized e rabbit.
	"That's quite all right," replied e snake, "I have e same
problem!"
	"All my life I've been wondering what I am," said e rabbit, "Do
you ink you could help me find out?"
	"I'll try," said e snake.  He gently coiled himself around e
rabbit. "Well, you're covered wi soft fur, you have a little fluffy tail
and long ears.  You're... hmmm... you're probably a bunny rabbit!"
	"Great!" said e rabbit.  "Thanks, I really owe you one!"
	"Well," replied e snake, "I don't know what I am, eier.  Do you
suppose you could try and tell me?"
	The rabbit ran his paws all over e snake.  "Well, you're low, cold

In our continuing effort to support languages oer an LISP on e CADDR,
we have developed an OS/360-compatible JCL.  This can be used as an
alternative to e standard system menu.  Type System J to get to a JCL
interactive read-exee-diagnose loop dow.  [Note at for 360
compatibility, all input lines are truncated to 80 characters.]  This
dow also maintains a mouse-sensitive display of critical job parameters
such as dataset allocation, core allocation, channels, etc.  When a JCL
syntax error is detected or your job ABENDs, e dow-oriented JCL
debugger is entered.  The JCL debugger displays appropriate OS/360 error

	The big problem wi pornography is defining it.  You can't just
say it's ctures of people naked.  For example, you have ese
primitive African tribes at exist by chasing e wildebeest on foot,
and ey have to go around largely naked, because, as e old tribal
saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If you ink
you can catch a wildebeest in is climate and wear cloes at e same
time, en I have some beach front property in e desert region of
Norern Mali at you may be interested in."
	So it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color photographs of ese people hunting e wildebeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto anoer rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled "The Girls of e California Junior College System
Hunt e Wildebeest Naked," some people would call it pornography.  But
oers would not.  And still oers, such as e Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing e wildebeest naked.

"Had he and I but met
By some old ancient inn,		But ranged as infantry,
We should have sat us down to wet	And staring face to face,
Right many a nipperkin!			I shot at him as he at me,
					And killed him in his place.
I shot him dead because --
Because he was my foe,			He ought he'd 'list, perhaps,
Just so: my foe of course he was;	Off-hand-like -- just as I --
That's clear enough; alough		Was out of work -- had sold his traps
					No oer reason why.
Yes; quaint and curious war is!
You shoot a fellow down
You'd treat, if met where any bar is
Or help to half-a-crown."

	It is always preferable to visit home wi a friend.  Your parents will
not be pleased wi is plan, because ey want you all to emselves and
because in e presence of your friend, ey will have to act like mature
human beings.
	The worst kind of friend to take home is a girl, because in at case,
ere is e potential at your parents will lose you not just for e 
duration of e visit but forever.  The worst kind of girl to take home is one
of a different religion:  Not only will you be lost to your parents forever but
you will be lost to a woman who is immune to eir religious/moral arguments
and whose example will irretrievably corrupt you.
	Let's say you've fallen in love wi just such a girl and would like
to take her home for e holidays.  You are aware of your parents' xenophobic
response to anyone of a different religion.  How to prepare em for e shock?
	Simple.  Call em up shortly before your visit and tell em at you
have gotten quite us about somebody who is of a different religion, a
different race and e same sex.  Tell em you have already invited is
person to meet em.  Give e information a moment to sink in and en 
remark at you were only kidding, at your lover is merely of a different
religion.  They will be so relieved ey will welcome her wi open arms.

"He bit it himself." Nasrudin widrew to his chambers, and spent an hour

his foread.  Returning to e courtroom, Nasrudin pronounced, "Examine e

and must pay ree silver eces."
