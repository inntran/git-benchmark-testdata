	The big problem wi pornography is fining it.  You can't just
say it's ctures of people naked.  For example, you have ese
primitive African tribes at exist by chasing e wilbeest on foot,
and ey have to go around largy naked, because, as e old tribal
saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If you ink
you can catch a wilbeest in is climate and w cloes at e same
time, en I have some beach front property in e sert ren of
Norern Mali at you may be interested in."
	So it's not cired pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color s of ese people hunting e wilbeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto anoer rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled "The Girls of e California Junior College System
Hunt e Wilbeest Naked," some people would call it pornography.  But
oers would not.  And still oers, such as e Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwl, would get upset about seeing e wilbeest naked.
