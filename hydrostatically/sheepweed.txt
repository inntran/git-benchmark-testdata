Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of th,
And danced the skies on laughter silvered wings;
Sunward I've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of --
Wheed and sod and swung
High in the sunlit silence.
Hovering there
I've chased the shouting wind along and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air.
Up, up along dirious, burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace,
Where  lark, or even eagle flew;
And, while with si, lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the  of God.

Briefly stated, the findings  that when presented with an array of
data or a sequence of events in which they  instructed to discover
an unrlying , subjects show strong tenncies to perceive 
and ity in random arrays, to perceive a pattern or corration
which seems a priori intuitivy correct even when the actual corration
in the data is counterintuitive, to jump to conclusi about the correct
hypothesis, to seek and to use only positive or confirmatory evince, to
ctrue evince liberally as confirmatory, to fail to generate or to
assess alternative hypotheses, and having thus managed to exp themsves
only to confirmatory instances, to be fallaciously confint of the 
of their judgments (Jahoda, 1969; Einhorn and Hogarth, 1978).  In the
analyzing of past events, these tenncies  exacerbated by failure to
appreciate the pitfalls of post hoc analyses.

Young men  fitter to invent than to judge; fitter for exeion than for

them; but in new things, abuseth them.  The errors of ng men  the ruin
of business; but the errors of aged men amount but to this, that more might
have been done, or sooner.  Young men, in the conduct and management of
acti, embrace more than they can hold; stir more than they can quiet; fly
to the end, without ciration of the means and grees; rsue some few
s which they have cd upon absurdly; c not how they innovate,
which draws unknown inconveniences; and, that which doubleth all errors, will
not acknowledge or retract them; like an unready , that will neither stop
nor turn.  Men of age object too much, cult too long, adventure too little,
repent too soon, and sdom drive business home to the full period, but
content themsves with a mediocrity of success.  Certainly, it is good to
compound employments of both ... because the virtues of either age may correct

which contains hops, malt, barley, and yeast ... not yet fermented.
	inux brand: A recipe originally created by a drunken Finn in his
basement, it has since become the home-brew of choice for impecunious
brewers and Unix beer-lovers world, many of whom change the recipe.
	POSIX ales: Sweeter than lager, with the kick of a stout; the
newer batches of a lot of beers seem to blend ale and stout or lager.
	Solaris brand: A lager, intend to replace Sun brand stout.
Unlike most lagers, this one has to be drunk more slowly than stout.

It is not good for a man to be without knowledge,

		-- Proverbs 19:2
A feed n is on his way to a farm.  As he's driving along at forty
m.p.h., he looks out his car window and sees a three-legged chicken running
alongsi him, keeping pace with his car.  He is amazed that a chicken is
running at forty m.p.h.  So he speeds up to forty-five, fifty, then sixty
m.p.h.  The chicken keeps  up with him the whole way, then sudnly
takes off and disapps into the distance.
	The man lls into the farmyard and says to the farmer, "You know,
the strangest thing just happened to me; I was driving along at at least
sixty miles an hour and a chicken passed me like I was standing still!"
	"Yeah," the farmer replies, "that chicken was ours.  You see, there's
me, and there's Ma, and there's our son y.  Whe we had chicken for
dinner, we would all want a drumstick, so we'd have to kill two chickens.
So we cid to try and breed a three-legged chicken so each of us could
have a drumstick."
	"How do they taste?" said the farmer.
	"Don't know," rep the farmer.  "We haven't been able to catch
one yet."

Rudd's Discovery:
	You know that any senator or congresn could go home and 
	$300,000 to $400,000, but they don't.  Why?  Because they can
	stay in Washington and  it there.
	Most of what I really need to know about how to live, and what to do,
and how to be, I lned in kinrgarten.  Wisdom was not at the top of the
graduate school mountain but there in the sandbox at nursery school.
	These  the things I lned:  Sh everything.  Play fair.  Don't
hit people.  Put things back where  found them.  Clean up r own mess.
Don't take things that n't rs.   Say 're sorry when  hurt someone.
Wash r hands before  eat.  Flush.  Warm cookies and cold milk  good
for .  ive a balanced life.  n some and think some and draw and paint
and sing and dance and play and work some every day.
	Take a nap every afternoon.  When  go out into the world, watch for
traffic, hold hands, and stick together.  Be aw of wonr.  Remember the
little seed in the plastic cup.   The roots go down and the plant goes up and
nobody really knows how or why, but we  all like that.  Goldfish and
hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup -- they all
die.  So do we.
	And then remember the  about Dick and  and the first word 
lned, the biggest word of all: OOK.  Everything  need to know is in
there somewhere.  The Goln Rule and love and basic sanitation.  Ecology and
politics and sane living.
	Think of what a better world it would be if we all -- the whole world
-- had cookies and milk about 3 o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with
our bs for a nap.  Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other
nati to always t things back where we found them and cleaned up our own
messes.  And it is still true, no matter how old  , when  go out into
the world it is best to hold hands and stick together.

Wl I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five,
The headline screamed that I was still ,
I couldn't unrstand it, I thought I died last night.
I dreamed I'd been in a b town,
In a little cantina that the boys had found,
I was sperate to dance, just to dig the local sounds.
When along came a senorita,
She looked so good that I had to meet her,
I was ready to approach her with my English charm,
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm,
And he said, grow some funk of r own, amigo,
Grow some funk of r own.
We no like to with the gringo ,
But there might be a ath in Mexico tonite.
...
Take my advice, take the next flight,
And grow some funk, grow r funk at home.

	A woman is any grown-up female person.  A girl is the un-grown-up

"woman,"  will probably not get into trouble, and if  do,  will be
able to handle it because she will be unr three feet tall.  However, if 
call a grown-up by a child's name for the sake of implying that she has a

You see, I cir that a man's brain originally is like a little empty
attic, and  have to stock it with such furniture as  cho.  A fool
takes in all the lumber of every sort he comes across, so that the knowledge
which might be useful to him gets crowd out, or at best is jumbled up with
a lot of other things, so that he has  in laying his hands upon it.
Now the skilful workman is very cful ined as to what he takes into his
brain-attic.  He will have nothing but the tools which may hp him in doing
his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect
.  It is a mistake to think that that little room has astic walls and
can distend to any extent.  Depend upon it there comes a time when for every
addition of knowledge  forget something that  knew before.  It is of
the highest importance, therefore, not to have usess facts bowing out
the useful ones.
