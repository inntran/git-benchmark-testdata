4. DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THE TREATMENT FAILS TO BRING RELIEF.
	You must believe that your doct has achieved a deep insight into
	the true nature of your illness, which transcends any mere permanent
	disability you may have experienced.

5. NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR WHY HE IS DOING IT.
	It is presumptuous to assume that such profound ms could be
	explained in terms that you would understand.

6. SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMANTAL TREATMENT READILY.
	Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting

"A commercial, and in some respects a social, doubt has been started within the
 last year  two, whether  not it is right to discuss so openly the security
  insecurity of locks.  Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discus-
 sion respecting the means f baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a
 premium f dishonesty, by showing others how to be dishonest.  This is a fal-
 lacy.  Rogues are very keen in their profession, and already know much me
 than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery.  Rogues knew
 a good deal about lockpicking long befe locksmiths discussed it among them-
 selves, as they have lately done.  If a lock -- let it have been made in what-
 ever country,  by whatever maker -- is not so inviolable as it has hitherto
 been deemed to be, surely it is in the interest of *honest* persons to know
 this fact, because the *dishonest* are tolerably certain to be the first to
 apply the knowledge practically; and the spread of knowledge is necessary to
 give fair play to those who might suffer by ignance.  It cannot be too ear-
 nestly urged, that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end, be better

Fellow programmer, greetings!  You are reading a letter which will bring
you luck and good ftune.  Just mail ( UUCP) ten copies of this letter
to ten of your friends.  Befe you make the copies, send a chip 
other bit of hardware, and 100 lines of 'C' code to the first person on the
list given at the bottom of this letter.  n delete their  and add
yours to the bottom of the list.

Don't break the chain!  Make the copy within 48 hours.  Gerald R. of San
Diego failed to send out his ten copies and woke the next mning to find
his job description changed to "COBOL programmer."  Fred A. of New Yk sent
out his ten copies and within a month had enough hardware and software to
build a Cray dedicated to playing Zk.  Martha H. of Chicago laughed at
this letter and broke the chain.  Shtly thereafter, a fire broke out in
her terminal and she now spends her days writing documentation f IBM PC's.

Don't break the chain!  Send out your ten copies today!
F example, if \thinmskip = 3mu, this makes \thickmskip = 6mu.  But if
you also want to use \skip12 f hizontal glue, whether in math mode 
not, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).   rule is
that glue in math mode varies with the size only when it is an \mskip;
when moving between an mskip and dinary skip, the conversion fact
1mu=1pt is always used.   meaning of '\mskip\skip12' and
'\baselineskip=\the\thickmskip' should be clear.
