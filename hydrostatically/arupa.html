complete text:

"(1) How much did you make?  (AMOUNT)
(2) How much did we here at the government take out?  (AMOUNT)
(3) Hey!  Sounds like we took too much!  So we're going to
     send an official government c f (ONE-FIFTEENTH OF
     THE AMOUNT WE TOOK) directly to the (YOUR LAST NAME)
     housold at (YOUR ADDRESS), f you to spend in any way
     you please! Which just goes to show you, (YOUR FIRST
     NAME), that it pays to file the sht fm!"

 IRS wants you to use this fm because it gets to keep most of your
money.  So unless you have pond silt f brains, you want the long fm.
