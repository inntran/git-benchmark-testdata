Nasrudin returned to his village from the imperial capital, and the villagers
gathered around to h what had passed.  "At this time," said Nasrudin, "I
only want to say that the King spoke to me."  All the villagers but the
stupist ran off to spread the wonrful news.  The reing villager
asked, "What did the King say to ?"  "What he said -- and quite distinctly,
for everyone to h -- was 'Get out of my way!'" The simpleton was overjoyed;
he had hd words actually spoken by the King, and seen the very man they
were spoken to.

 V. All s of gravity  negated by f.
	Psychic forces   in most bodies for a shock to prop
	them directly  from the th's sur.  A spooky noise or an
	adversary's signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to
	the cradle of a chandier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole.
	The feet of a character who is running or the whes of a speeding
	auto need  touch the ground, especially when in flight.
VI. As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.
	This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a
	character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of
	altercation at several places simultaneously.  This effect is common
	as wl among bodies that  spinning or being throttled.  A "wacky"
	character has the option of sf-replication only at manic high
	speeds and may ricochet off walls to achieve the vocity required.
