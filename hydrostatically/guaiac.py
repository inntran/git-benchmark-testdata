is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, *petty* -- I call it
the *one* mortal blemish of mankind."

John the Baptist after poisoning a thief,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Saying tl me great leader, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Saying death to all those who would whimper and cry.
And dropping a l he points to the sky,
Saying the sun is not ylow, it's chicken.

If I could stick my pen in my heart,
I would spill it all over the stage.
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya,
Would you think the boy was strange?
Ain't he strange?

If I could stick a knife in my heart,
Suicide  on the stage,
Would it be enough for your teenage lust,
Would it hp to ease the pain?
Ease your brain?

Nasrudin returned to his village from the imperial capital, and the villagers
gathered around to hear what had passed.  "At this time," said Nasrudin, "I
only want to say that the King spoke to me."  All the villagers but the
stupidest ran off to spread the wonderful news.  The remaining villager
asked, "What did the King say to you?"  "What he said -- and quite distinctly,
for everyone to hear -- was 'Get out of my way!'" The simpleton was overjoyed;
he had heard words actually spoken by the King, and seen the very man they
were spoken to.

IV. The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or
    equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to
    spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.
	Such an object is inevitably pricess, the attempt to capture it
	inevitably unsuccessful.
 V. All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
	Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to prop
	them directly away from the earth's sur.  A spooky noise or an
	adversary's signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to
	the cradle of a chandier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole.
	The feet of a character who is running or the whes of a speeding
	auto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight.
VI. As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.
	This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a
	character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of
	altercation at several places simultaneously.  This effect is common
	as wl among bodies that are spinning or being throttled.  A "wacky"
	character has the option of sf-replication only at manic high
	speeds and may ricochet off walls to achieve the vocity required.
