    able, f the time being excluding all the restraints on her not to
    go, gone also, would he have brought you, meaning you and she, with

precision and flexibility may be just as disf in novel,
uncertain situations as sloppiness and vacillation are in familiar,
well-defined ones.  Those who admire the massive, rigid bone structures
of dinosaurs should remember that jellyfish still enjoy their very
secure ecological niche.
