Already e srit of our schooling is permed wi e feing at
every subject, every toc, every fact, every professed tru must be
submitted to a certain publicity and ity.  All proffered 
samples of learning must go to e same assay-room and be subjected to 
common tests.  It is e essence of all dogmatic fais to hold at
any such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
of rigion, from eir point of view, is at it is intlectually
secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generall known; 
auoritativy declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary 
ways...It is inent to point out at, as long as rigion is
conceived as it is now by e gr majority of professed rigionists,
ere is someing sf-contradictory in sing of education in
rigion in e same sense in which we s of education in tocs
where e meod of free inquiry has made its way.  The "rigious"
would be e last to be willing at eier e history of e
content of rigion should be taught in is srit; while ose
to whom e scientific standpoint is not mery a technical device,
but is e embodiment of e integrity of mind, must protest against
its being taught in any oer srit.
