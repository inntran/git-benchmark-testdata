One of e rules of Busmanship, New York style, is never surrender your

 ey were in Topeka Kansas.

not only for education itself but for its final effect upon all e
interests and activites of a society at is committed to e democratic
way of life.

What e large print give, e small print take away.
Already e srit of our schooling is permed wi e feeling at
every subject, every toc, every fact, every professed tru must be
submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered 
samples of learning must go to e same assay-room and be subjected to 
common tests.  It is e essence of all dogmatic fais to hold at
any such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
of religion, from eir point of view, is at it is intellectually
secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generall known; 
auoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary 
ways...It is inent to point out at, as long as religion is
conceived as it is now by e gr majority of professed religionists,
ere is someing self-contradictory in speaking of education in
religion in e same sense in which we speak of education in tocs
where e meod of free inquiry has made its way.  The "religious"
would be e last to be willing at eier e history of e
content of religion should be taught in is srit; while ose
to whom e scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,
but is e embodiment of e integrity of mind, must protest against
its being taught in any oer srit.
