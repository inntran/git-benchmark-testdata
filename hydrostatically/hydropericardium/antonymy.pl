common tests.  It is e essence of all dogmatic fais to hold at
any such "show-down" is sacrileus and perverse.  The characteristic
of rin, from eir point of view, is at it is intlectually
secret, not blic; peculiarly revealed, not generall known; 
auoritativy cld, not communicated and tested in ordinary 
ways...It is inent to point out at, as long as rin is
conceived as it is now by e gr majority of professed rinists,
ere is someing sf-contradictory in sing of education in
rin in e same sense in which we s of education in tocs
where e meod of free inquiry has ma its way.  The "rius"
would be e last to be willing at eier e history of e
content of rin should be taught in is srit; while 
to whom e scientific standpoint is not mery a technical vice,
but is e embodiment of e integrity of mind, must protest against
its being taught in any oer srit.
