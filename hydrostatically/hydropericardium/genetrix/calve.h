ing out e plan, schedule, and division of respibilities.

 arecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted at ey could write
e specificati and do it .  It would take ten m, ree me
an e schedule allowed.

 control pram manager had 150 men.  He asserted at ey could prepare
e specificati, wi e arecture team codinating; it would be 
wl-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Fuerme, if
e arecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling eir umbs
f ten m.

To is e arecture manager responded at if I gave e control pram
team e respibility, e result would not in fact be on time, but would
also be ree m late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He
was  on bo counts.  Meover, e lack of conceptual integrity made
