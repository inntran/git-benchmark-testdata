Many Americans wk side by side with space aliens who look human -- but you

	jokes that no one understands, said Steiger.
    (6) Misuses everyday items.  "A space alien may use crection
	fluid to paint its nails," said Steiger.
    (8) Secretive about personal life-style and home.  "An alien won't
	discuss details  talk about what it does at night  on weekends."
   (10) Displays a change of mood  physical reaction when near certain
	high-tech hardware.  "An alien may experience a mood change when
	a microwave oven is turned on," said Steiger.

It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but it
is also very memable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to ganize
the actual writing of external specifications f OS/360.   manager of
architecture, the manager of control program implementation, and I were
threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.

 architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write
the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three me
than the schedule allowed.

 control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare
the specifications, with the architecture team codinating; it would be 
well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futherme, if
the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs
f ten months.

To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program
team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would
also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He
was right on both counts.  Meover, the lack of conceptual integrity made
the system far me costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it
added a year to debugging time.
