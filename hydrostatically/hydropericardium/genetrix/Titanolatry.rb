	Young men and ng women may work systematically six days in the
week and rise fresh in the morning, but let them attend morn dances for
only a few hours each evening and see what happens.  The Waltz, Polka,
Gallop and other dances of the same kind will be disastrous in their effects
to both sexes.  Health and vigor will vh like the w before the sun.
	It is not the extraory exercise which harms the dancer, but
rather the coming into cl contact with the opposite sex.  It is the
fury of lust craving incessantly for more pleasure that unrmines the
soul, the body, the sinews and nerves.  Experience and statistics show
beyond doubt that passionate excessive dancing girls can hardly reach
twenty-five ys of age and men thirty-one.  Even if they reached that
age they will in most instances be broken in health physically and morally.
This is the claim of prominent physicians in this country.

	My friends, I am here to tell  of the wonrous continent known as
Africa.  Well we left New York drunk and ly on the morning of February 31.
We were 15 days on the water, and 3 on the boat when we finally d in
Africa.  Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at
6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by
6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That
was the biggest game we had.  Africa is primerally inhabited by Elks, Mo
and Knights of Pithiests.
	The elks live up in the mountains and come down once a y for their
annual conventi.  And  should see them gathered around the water hole,
which they leave immediately when they discover it's full of water.  They
weren't looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.
	One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my
pajamas, I don't know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That's a tough
word to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were
imbedd so firmly we couldn't get them out.  But in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,
but that is totally irrelephant to what I was saying.
	We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't veloped.
So we're going back in a few ys...
