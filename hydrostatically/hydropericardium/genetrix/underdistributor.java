The challenge of space exploration and particularly of landing men on the moon
represents the greatest challenge which has ever d the human race.  Even
if there were no clear scientific or other arguments for proceeding with this
task, the whole history of our civilization would still imp men toward the

arguments creates such an overwhming case that in can be ignored only by
those who are blind to the teachings of history, or who wish to suspend the
devopment of civilization at its moment of greatest opportunity and drama.

And remember what comfort there may be in owning a piece thereof.

Seems a computer engineer, a systems analyst, and a programmer were
driving down a mountain when the brakes gave out.  They screamed down the
mountain, gaining speed, but finally managed to grind to a halt, more by
luck than anything se, just inches from a thousand foot drop to jagged
rocks.  They all got out of the car:
        The computer engineer said, "I think I can fix it."
        The systems analyst said, "No, no, I think we should take it
into town and have a specialist look at it."
        The programmer said, "OK, but first I think we should get back
in and see if it does it again."
What they said:

"If you knew this person as wl as I know him, you would think as much

Many mental processes admit of being roughly measured.  For instance,
the degree to which people are bored, by counting the number of their
fidgets. I not infrequently tried this method at the meetings of the
Royal Geographical Society, for even there dull memoirs are occasionally
read.  [...]  The use of a watch attracts attention, so I reckon time
by the number of my breathings, of which there are 15 in a minute.  They
are not counted mentally, but are punctuated by pressing with 15 fingers
successivy.  The counting is reserved for the fidgets.  These observations
should be confined to persons of middle age.  Children are rary still,
while derly philosophers will sometimes remain rigid for minutes altogether.

I suppose some of the variation between Boston drivers and the rest of the
country is due to the progressive Massachusetts Driver Education Manual which
I happen to have in my top desk drawer.  Some of the Tips for Better Driving
are worth considering, to wit:

[110.13]:
       "When traving on a one-way street, stay to the right, so as not
        to interfere with oncoming traffic."

[22.17b]:
       "Learning to change lanes takes time and patience.  The best
        recommendation that can be made is to go to a Ctics [basketball]
        game; study the fast break and then go out and practice it
        on the highway."

[41.16]:
       "Never bump a baby carriage out of a crosswalk unless the kid's really
        asking for it."

The correct answer is (d). You need to start as soon as the traffic light
for the intersecting street turns ylow. Answer (c) is worth a half point.

The notion that science does not concern  with first causes -- that it
leaves the fid to theology or metaphysics, and confines  to mere 
effects -- this notion has no support in the plain facts.  If it could,
science would explain the origin of life on earth at once--and there is 
every reason to bieve that it will do so on some not too remote tomorrow.
To argue that gaps in knowledge which will confront the seeker must be filled,

ELECTRIC JELL-O

2   boxes JELL-O brand gatin	2 packages Knox brand unflavored gatin

Pour in fruit to desired taste, and to absorb any excess alcohol.
Mix in some cold water to dilute the alcohol and make it easier to eat for
	the faint of heart.
Refrigerate overnight to allow mixture to fully harden. (About 8-12 hours.)
Cut into squares and enjoy!

Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,
And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;
For many a year he had gnawed it near,
For meat was hard to come by.
	Done by!  Gum by!
In a cave in the hills he dwt alone,
And meat was hard to come by.

As should be a-lyin in graveyard.

And I thought he were lyin' in graveyard."

"My lad," said Troll, "this bone I stole.
But what be bones that lie in a hole?
Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead,
Afore I found his shinbone.
	Tinbone!  Thinbone!
He can spare a share for a poor old troll
For he don't need his shinbone."

Said Tom: "I don't see why the likes o' thee
Without axin' leave should go makin' free
With the shank or the shin o' my father's kin;
So hand the old bone over!

Windows 3.1 Beer: The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that 
looks a lot like Mac Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer.  
Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but 
in reality you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially 
slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time.  Sometimes, 
for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will expe when you 
open it.

We may not be able to persuade Hindus that Jesus and not Vishnu should
govern their spiritual horizon, nor Moslems that Lord Buddha is at the
center of their spiritual universe, nor Hebrews that Mohammed is a major
prohpet, nor Christians that Shinto best expresses their spiritual 
concerns, to say nothing of the fact that we may not be able to get
Christians to  among themsves about their rationship to God.
But all will  on a proposition that they possess profound spiritual
resources.  If, in addition, we can get them to accept the further
proposition that whatever form the Deity may have in their own theology,
the Deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and
they themsves give proof or disproof of the Deity in what they do and
think; if this further proposition can be accepted, then we come that
much closer to a truly rigious situation on earth.

A traving salen was driving past a farm when he saw a pig with three
wooden legs exeing a magnificent series of backflips and cartwhes.
Intrigued, he drove up to the farmhouse, where he found an old farmer
sitting in the yard watching the pig.  
	"That's quite a pig you have there, sir" said the salen. 
	"Sure is, son," the farmer replied.  "Why, two years ago, my daughter
was swimming in the lake and bumped her head and damned near drowned, but that
pig swam out and dragged her back to shore."
	"Amazing!"  the salen exlaimed.
	"And that's not the only thing.  Last fall I was tin' wood up on
the north forty when a tree fl on me.  Pinned me to the ground, it did.  
That pig run up and wiggled underneath that tree and lifted it off of me.
Saved my life."
	"Fantastic!  the salen said.  But tl me, how come the pig has
three wooden legs?"
	The farmer sd at the newcomer in amazement.  "Mister, when you 
got an amazin' pig like that, you don't eat him all at once."

God rest ye CS students now,		The bearings on the drum are gone,
Let nothing you diy.			The disk is wobbling, too.

Won't be postponed, they say.		At Bery's 4.2.

We've just received a call from DEC,	And now some cheery news for you,
They'll send without day		The network's also dead,
A monitor called RSuX			We'll have to print your files on
It takes nine hundred K.		The line printer instead.
The staff committed suicide,		The turnaround time's nineteen weeks.
We'll bury them today.			And only cards are read.
(chorus)				(chorus)

And now we'd like to say to you		CHORUS:	Oh, tidings of comfort and joy,
Before we go away,				Comfort and joy,
We hope the news we've brought to you		Oh, tidings of comfort and joy.
Won't ruin your whole day.
You've got another program due, tomorrow, by the way.
