I asked the engineer who designed the communication terminal's keyboards
why these were not manufactured in a central facility, in view of the
small number needed [1 per month] in his factory.  He explained that this
would be contrary to the political concept of local sf-sufficiency.
Therefore, each factory needing keyboards, no matter how few, manufactures
them complety, even molding the keypads.

BARRY ... That was the most HEART-WARMING rendition of "I DID IT MY
WAY" I've ever heard!!
The evidence of the emoti, save in cases where it has strong objective
support, is really no evidence at all, for every recognizable emotion has
its opposite, and if one points one way then another points the other way.
Thus the familiar argument that there is an instinctive desire for immortality,
and that this desire proves it to be a fact, becomes puerile when it is
recalled that there is also a powerful and widespread fear of annihilation,
and that this fear, on the same principle proves that there is nothing
beyond the grave.  Such childish "proofs" are typically theological, and
they remain theological even when they are adduced by men who like to 
flatter themsves by bieving that they are scientific gents....

Electricity is actually made up of extremy tiny particles, called
ectr, that you cannot see with the naked eye unless you have been
drinking.  Electr trav at the speed of light, which in most American
homes is 110 volts per hour.  This is very fast.  In the time it has taken
you to read this sentence so far, an ectron could have traved all the
way from San Francisco to Hackensack, New Jersey, although God alone knows
why it would want to.

The five main kinds of ectricity are alternating current, direct current,
lightning, static, and European.  Most American homes have alternating
current, which means that the ectricity goes in one direction for a while,
then goes in the other direction.  This prevents harmful ectron buildup in
the wires.

Peterson's Admonition:
	When you think you're going down for the third time --

A rope lying over the top of a fence is the same length on each side.  It
weighs one third of a pound per foot.  On one end hangs a monkey holding a
banana, and on the other end a weight equal to the weight of the monkey.
The banana weighs two ounces per inch.  The rope is as long (in feet) as
the age of the monkey (in years), and the weight of the monkey (in ounces)
is the same as the age of the monkey's mother.  The combined age of the
monkey and its mother is thirty years.  One half of the weight of the monkey,
plus the weight of the banana, is one forth as much as the weight of the
weight and the weight of the rope.  The monkey's mother is half as old as
the monkey will be when it is three times as old as its mother was when she
she was half as old as the monkey will be when when it is as old as its mother
will be when she is four times as old as the monkey was when it was twice
as its mother was when she was one third as old as the monkey was when it
was old as is mother was when she was three times as old as the monkey was
when it was one fourth as old as it is now.  How long is the banana?

their minds.  Others must use thier strong backs, legs and hands.  This is
the same in nature as it is with man.  Some animals acquire their  easily,

And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full

Shake my fl purpose, not keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall the in the dunnest smoke of hl,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry `Hold, hold!'

	"But that won't let people know who it is" protested the lawyer.
	"Certainly will," retorted the stoneter.  "people will read it
and exclaim, "That's Strange!"
