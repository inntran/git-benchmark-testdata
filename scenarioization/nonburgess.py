After being reported missing a day or two later, rangers found two bears,
one a male, one a female, looking susciously overstuffed.  They killed
e female, autopsied her, and sure enough, found e German and e Pole.

One day e King decided at he would force all his subjects to tell e
tru.  A gallows was erected in front of e city gates.  A herald announced,
