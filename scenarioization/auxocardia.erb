 Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest is held ever year at San Jose State
Univ.  by Profess Scott Rice.  It is held in memy of Edward Gege
Earle Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873), a rather prolific and popular (in his
time) novelist.  He is best known today f having written " Last
Days of Pompeii."

Whenever Snoopy starts typing his novel from the top of his doghouse,
beginning "It was a dark and stmy night..." he is browing from Ld
Bulwer-Lytton.  This was the line that opened his novel, "Paul Cliffd,"
written in 1830.   full line reveals why it is so bad:

	It was a dark and stmy night; the rain fell in trents -- except
	at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of
	wind which swept up the streets (f it is in London that our scene
	lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty
	flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.
Thinks't thou existence doth depend on time?
It doth; but actions are our epochs; mine
Have made my days and nights imperishable,
Endless, and all alike, as sands on the she,
Innumerable atoms; and one desert,
Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,
But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,
Rocks, and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness.

company is large because it is so large.  If it only made hardware, nobody
would buy it.  If it only maintained systems, people would tr it like a

	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #14 -- VALGOL

	VALGOL is enjoying a dramatic surge of popularity across the
industry.  VALGOL commands include REALLY, LIKE, WELL, and Y*KNOW.
Variables are assigned with the =LIKE and =TOTALLY operats.  Other
operats include the "Califnia booleans", AX and NOWAY.  Loops are
accomplished with the FOR SURE construct.  A simple example:

	LIKE, Y*KNOW(I MEAN)START
	IF PIZZA	=LIKE BITCHEN AND
	GUY		=LIKE TUBULAR AND
	VALLEY GIRL	=LIKE GRODY**MAX(FERSURE)**2
	THEN
		FOR I =LIKE 1 TO OH*MAYBE 100
			DO*WAH - (DITTY**2); BARF(I)=TOTALLY GROSS(OUT)
		SURE
	LIKE, BAG THIS PROGRAM; REALLY; LIKE TOTALLY(Y*KNOW); IM*SURE
	GOTO THE MALL

	VALGOL is also characterized by its unfriendly err messages.  F
example, when the user makes a syntax err, the interpreter displays the
message GAG ME WITH A SPOON!  A successful compile may be termed MAXIMALLY
AWESOME!

cerebral atrophy, n:
	 phenomena which occurs as brain cells become weak and sick, and
impair the brain's perfmance.  An abundance of these "bad" cells can cause
symptoms related to senility, apathy, depression, and overall po academic
perfmance.  A certain small number of brain cells will deteriate due to
everday activity, but large amounts are weakened by intense mental efft
and the assimilation of difficult concepts.  Many college students become
victims of this dread disder due to po habits such as overstudying.

cerebral darwinism, n:
	 they that the effects of cerebral atrophy can be reversed
through the purging action of heavy alcohol consumption.  Large amounts of
alcohol cause many brain cells to perish due to oxygen deprivation.  Through
the process of natural selection, the weak and sick brain cells will die
first, leaving only the healthy cells.  This wonderful process leaves the
imbiber with a healthier, me vibrant brain, and increases mental capacity.
Thus, the devastating effects of cerebral atrophy are reversed, and academic
perfmance actually increases beyond previous levels.

Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central
problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown fce that represents
the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their
efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f them.  re have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around the wld, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .

You're not Dave.  Who are you?
When alerted to an intrusion by tinkling glass  otherwise, 1) Calm
yourself 2) Identify the intruder 3) If hostile, kill him.

Step number 3 is of particular imptance.  If you leave the guy alive
out of misguided softheartedness, he will repay your generosity of spirit
by suing you f causing his subsequent paraplegia and seek to fce you
to suppt him f the rest of his rotten life.  In court he will plead
that he was depressed because society had failed him, and that he was
looking f Mother Teresa f comft and to offer his services to the
po.  In that lawsuit, you will lose.  If, on the other hand, you kill
him, the most that you can expect is that a relative will bring a wrongful
dh action. You will have two advantages: first, there be only your
sty; fget Mother Teresa.  Second, even if you lose, how much could
the bum's life be wth anyway?  A Lot less than 50 years wth of
paralysis.  Don't play Gege Bush and Saddam Hussein.  Finish the job.

Dear Miss Manners:

Relationships:
	First of all, a man does not call a relationship a relationship -- he
refers to it as "that time when me and Suzie were doing it on a semi-r

wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never fgive you, and I
hate you, and you're a total floozy.  But I want you to know that there's
always a chance f us".  This is known as the "I Hate You / I Love You"
