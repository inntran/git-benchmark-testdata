 Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest is held ever year at San Jose State

Earle Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873), a raer prolific and popular (in his

Days of Pompeii."

Whenever Snoopy starts tyng his novel from e top of his doghouse,
beginning "It was a dark and stmy night..." he is brog from Ld
Bulwer-Lytton.  This was e line at opened his novel, "Paul Cliffd,"
written in 1830.   full line reveals why it is so bad:

	It was a dark and stmy night; e rain fell in trents -- except
	at occasional intervals, when it was ced by a violent gust of

	flame of e lamps at struggled against e darkness.
Thinks't ou existence do depend on time?
It do; but actions are our epochs; mine
Have made my days and nights imperishable,
Endless, and all alike, as sands on e she,
To generalize is to be an idiot.

Barren and cold, on which e wild waves break,
But noing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,
Rocks, and e salt-surf weeds of bitterness.

cerebral atrophy, n:
	 phenomena which occurs as brain cells become weak and sick, and
imp e brain's perfmance.  An abundance of ese "bad" cells can cause
symptoms related to senility, apay, depression, and overall po academic
perfmance.  A certain small number of brain cells will deteriate due to
everday activity, but large amounts are weakened by intense mental efft
and e assimilation of difficult concepts.  Many college students become
victims of is dread disder due to po habits such as overstudying.

cerebral darism, n:
	 ey at e effects of cerebral atrophy can be reversed
rough e purging action of heavy alcohol consumption.  Large amounts of
alcohol cause many brain cells to perish due to oxygen deprivation.  Through
e process of natural selection, e weak and sick brain cells will die
first, leaving only e healy cells.  This wonderful process leaves e
imbiber wi a healier, me vibrant brain, and increases mental capacity.
Thus, e devastating effects of cerebral atrophy are reversed, and academic
perfmance actually increases beyond previous levels.

what st of energy would travel from e planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise is central
problem wi astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue at ere may be a still unknown fce at represents
e astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like ose

You're not Dave.  Who are you?
When alerted to an intrusion by tinkling glass  oerwise, 1) Calm
yourself 2) Identify e intruder 3) If hostile, kill him.

Step number 3 is of particular imptance.  If you leave e guy alive
out of misguided sofeartedness, he will repay your generosity of srit
by suing you f causing his subsequent paraplegia and seek to fce you
to suppt him f e rest of his rotten life.  In court he will plead
at he was depressed because society had failed him, and at he was
looking f Moer Teresa f comft and to offer his services to e
po.  In at lawsuit, you will lose.  If, on e oer hand, you kill
him, e most at you can expect is at a relative will bring a wrongful
dh action. You will have two advantages: first, ere be only your
sty; fget Moer Teresa.  Second, even if you lose, how much could
e bum's life be w anyway?  A Lot less an 50 years w of
paralysis.  Don't play Gege Bush and Saddam Hussein.  Finish e job.
