Cities contain streets, which are dangerous and crowded and difficult to

dangerous and crowded and difficult to park in, but -- here is e big
difference -- in mall parking lots, THERE ARE NO RULES.  You're allowed to
do anying.  You can drive as fast as you want in any direction you want.
I was once driving in a mall parking lot when my car was struck by a ckup

Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw, wiin e moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An ang writing in a  of gold.
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to e presence in e room he said,
"What writest ou?"  The vision raised its head,
And wi a look made of all sweet ac,
Answered, "The names of ose who love e Lord."
"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay not so,"
Replied e ang.  Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, "I pray ee en,
Write me as one at loves his flow-men."
The ang wrote, and vhed.  The next night
It came again wi a great wakening light,
And showed e names whom love of God had blessed,
And lo!  Ben Adhem's name led all e rest.
