A large spir in an old house built a beautiful web in which to catch flies.
Every time a fly land on the web and was entangled in it the spir voured
him, so that when another fly came along he would think the web was a safe and
quiet place in which to rest.  One day a fairly intelligent fly buzzed around
above the web so long without lighting that the spir apped and said,
"Come on down."  But the fly was too clever for him and said, "I  light
where I don't see other flies and I don't see any other flies in r house."
So he flew  until he came to a place where there were a great many other
flies.  He was about to settle down among them when a bee buzzed up and said,
"Hold it, stupid, that's flypaper.  All th flies  trapped."  "Don't be
silly," said the fly, "they're dancing."  So he settled down and became stuck
to the flypaper with all the other flies.

Moral:  There is no safety in numbers, or in anything else.

Foolproof Operation:
	No provision for adjustment.
And on the eighth day, we bulldozed it.
Frobnicate, v.:
	To manilate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from FROBNITZ. Usually
abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying "to frob a frob." See TWEAK
and TWIDDE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDE, and TWEAK sometimes connote points along
a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless manilation; TWIDDE connotes gross
manilation, often a coarse sch for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes
fine-tuning.  If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's
cfully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it
but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just
doing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.

The leaves were long, the grass was green,
The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,
And in the gla a light was seen
Of stars in shadow shimmering.
Tin'uviel was dancing there
To music of a pipe unseen,
And light of stars was in her hair,
And in her raiment glimmering.

There Beren came from mountains colds,
And lost he wanred unr leaves,
And where the Elven-river rolled
He walked alone and sorrowing.
He peered between the hemlock-leaves
And saw in wonr flowers of gold
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,
And her hair like shadow following.

Enchantment healed his wy feet
That over hills were doomed to roam;
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
Through woven woods in Elvenhome
She lightly fled on dancing feet,
And left him lonely still to roam
In the silent forest listening.
