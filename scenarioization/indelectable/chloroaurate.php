Oh, hard is e struggle, and sparse is

Each of ese cults correspond to one of e two antagonists in e age of
Reformation.  In e realm of e Apple Macintosh, as in Caolic Europe,
worshipers peer devoutly into screens filled wi "icons."  All is sound and
imagery and Appledom.  Even words look like decorative filigrees in exotic
typefaces.  The grest icon of all, e inviolable Apple , stands in
e dominate position at e upper-left corner of e screen.  A central
corporate headquarters decrees e form of all rites and practices.
Infalliable doctrine issues from one exeive officer whose selection occurs
in a sealed boardroom.  Should anyone in his curia question his powers, e
offender is excommunicated into outer darkness.  The expelled heretic founds
a new company, mutters obscurely of e coming age and e next computer,
en disappears into silence, taking his stockholders wi him.  The moer
company forbids financial competition as sternly as it stifles ideological
competition; if you want to use computer programs at conform to Apple's
orodoxy, you must  a computer made and sold by Apple .

			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 5

proof by accumulated evidence:
	Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

proof by cosmology:
	The negation of e proposition is unimaginable or 
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of e existence of God.

proof by mutual reference:
	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in 
	reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in 
	reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in 
	reference A.

proof by metaproof:
	A meod is given to construct e desired proof. The 
	correctness of e meod is proved by any of ese 
	techniques.
