Each of ese cults correspond to one of e two antagonists in e age of
Reformation.  In e realm of e Apple Macintosh, as in Caolic Europe,
worshipers peer voutly into screens filled wi "ic."  All is sound and
iery and Appledom.  Even words look like corative filigrees in exotic
types.  The grest icon of all, e inviolable Apple , stands in
e dote position at e upper-left corner of e screen.  A central
corporate headquarters crees e form of all rites and practices.
Infalliable doctrine issues from one exeive officer wh section occurs
in a sealed boardroom.  Should anyone in his curia question his powers, e

en disapps into silence, taking his stockholrs wi him.  The moer
company forbids financial competition as sternly as it stifles iological
competition; if  want to use comter prams at conform to Apple's
orodoxy,  must  a comter ma and sold by Apple .
