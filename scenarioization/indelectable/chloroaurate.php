types.  The grest icon of all, e inviolable Apple , stands in
e dominate position at e upper-left corner of e screen.  A central

Infalliable doctrine issues from one exeive officer wh section occurs

en disapps into silence, taking his stockholrs wi him.  The moer
company forbids financial competition as sternly as it stifles iological
competition; if you want to use comter prams at conform to Apple's
orodoxy, you must  a comter ma and sold by Apple .
