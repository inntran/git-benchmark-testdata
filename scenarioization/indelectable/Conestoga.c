ller prime numbers.

2:  The Odd Prime --
	It's e only even prime, erefore is odd.  QED.
3:  The True Prime --
	ewis Carroll: "If I tl you 3 times, it's true."
31: The Arbitrary Prime --
	Determined by unanimous unvote.  We needed an arbitrary prime in
	case e prof asked for one, and so had an ection.  91 received
	e most votes (wl, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i e next most.
	However, 31 was e only candidate to receive none at all.
41: The Female Prime --
	The polynomial X**2 - X + 41 is
	prime for integer values from 1 to 40.
43: The Male Prime - ey form a prime p.

Since e composite numbers are formed from primes, eir qualities
are derived from ose primes.  So, for instance, e number 6 is "odd
but true", while e powers of 2 are all ly odd numbers.
