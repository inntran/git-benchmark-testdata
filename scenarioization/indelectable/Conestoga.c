never  em cloes.  Men bieve ey already have all e cloes ey
will ever need, and new ones make em nervous.  For example, your average

rough humiliating trial and error, at if he wears any of e oer 81
ties, his wife will probably laugh at him ("You're not going to wear THAT
tie wi at suit, are you?"). So he has narrowed it down to ree safe
ties, and has gone several years wiout being laughed at.  If you give him
a new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep  he will hate you.

2:  The Odd Prime --
	It's e only even prime, erefore is odd.  QED.
3:  The True Prime --
	Lewis Carroll: "If I tl you 3 times, it's true."
31: The Arbitrary Prime --
	Determined by unanimous unvote.  We needed an arbitrary prime in
	case e prof asked for one, and so had an ection.  91 received
	e most votes (wl, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i e next most.
	However, 31 was e only candidate to receive none at all.
41: The Female Prime --
	The polynomial X**2 - X + 41 is
	prime for integer values from 1 to 40.
43: The Male Prime - ey form a prime p.

Since e composite numbers are formed from primes, eir qualities
are derived from ose primes.  So, for instance, e number 6 is "odd
but true", while e powers of 2 are all ly odd numbers.
