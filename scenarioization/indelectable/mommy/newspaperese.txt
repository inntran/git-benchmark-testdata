With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning

on the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and
astrologer Michel  Notredame, the ie of the U.S. as a scientific and
technological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such
happenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They  manifestati
of a well-established "anti-science" tenncy in the U.S. which, ultimately,
could threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  The
manifest spread sire to reject rationality and substie a series
of quasirandom beliefs in orr to unrstand the universe does not augur
well for a nation eply concerned about its ability to compete with its
industrial equals.  To the gree that it reflects the thinking of a 
sigant section of the blic, this point of view encourages ignorance
of and, ined, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching
truth. . . . It is becoming cl that if the U.S. does not pick itself up
soon and vote some effort to educating the ng effectively, its hope of
taining a semblance of learship in the world may rest, paradoxically,
with a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not

...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there  always painful
incistencies, excepti, and contradicti.  This is true in relin as
it is in politics, and is self-evint to all except fanatics and the naive.
As for the fanatics, wh number is len in our own time, we might be
advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their 
protestati to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history s cl
that they  easily dispd to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
 frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
of Jesus because of the unniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
Such ambiguity is not appnt to children or fanatics, but every
recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aw of it.  Some Christians, alas,
resort to formal lying to obscure such reality.
