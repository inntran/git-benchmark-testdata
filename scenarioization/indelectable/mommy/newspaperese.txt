Assembling all their pleas in hex.	Sequel next did mock the lord

The highest rung.			In his bung.

And offered god such swinish swill

it was a piece of art, high art; there was delicacy of touch, clness of

over Bohr's desk was a horseshoe, securely nailed to the wall, with the
open end up in the approved manner (so it would catch the good luck and not
let it spill out).  The American said with a nervous laugh,
	"Surely you don't believe the horseshoe will bring you good luck,
do you, Professor Bohr?  After all, as a scientist --"
Bohr chuckled.
	"I believe no such thing, my good friend.  Not at all.  I am
scarcely likely to believe in such foolish nense.  However, I am told
that a horseshoe will bring you good luck whether you believe in it or not."

Warden.  After about a half mile the fella stopped and stooped over with
his hands on his thighs, whooping and heaving to catch his breath as the
Game Warden finally caught up to him.
	"et's see yer fishin' license, boy," the Warden gasped.  The
man pulled out his wallet and gave the Game Warden a valid fishing
license.

With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning
her husband's schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating os Angeles
on the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and
astrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and
technological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such
happenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They  manifestati
of a well-established "anti-science" tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,
could threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  The
manifest spread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series
of quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur
well for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its
industrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a 
significant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance
of and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching
truth. . . . It is becoming cl that if the U.S. does not pick itself up
soon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope of
maintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,
with a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not
suffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an appntly decaying society.

...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there  always painful
incistencies, excepti, and contradicti.  This is true in religion as
it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.
As for the fanatics, wh number is legion in our own time, we might be
advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their 
protestati to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes cl
that they  easily dispd to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
 frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
Such ambiguity is not appnt to children or fanatics, but every
recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aw of it.  Some Christians, alas,
resort to formal lying to obscure such reality.

Where, oh, where,  you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I sched the world over, and I thought I'd found true love.
You met another, and *PPHHHBBBBTTT*, you wuz gone.

Gloom, despair and agony on me.

D Sir,
	I am firmly oppd to the spread of microchips either to the home or
to the office,  We have more than enough of them foisted upon us in public
places.  They  a disgusting Americanism, and can only result in the farmers
being forced to grow smaller potatoes, which in turn will cause massive un-
employment in the already severely depressed agricultural industry.
	Yours faithfully,
	Capt. Quinton D'Arcy, J.P.
