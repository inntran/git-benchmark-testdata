An Animal at knows who it is, one at has a sense of his own identity, is
a discontented crure, doomed to cre new problems f himself f e
duration of his stay on is planet.  Since neier e mouse n e chip

discovery.  But as soon as e human animal who asked himself is question
emerged, he plunged himself and his descendants into an eternity of doubt
and brooding, tion and tru-seeking at has goaded him rough e
centures as reelentlessly as hunger  sexual longing.   chimp at does
not know at he exists is not driven to discover his igins and is spared
e tragic necessity of contemplating his own end.  And even if e animal 
experimenters succeed in teaching a chimp to count one hundred bs  
to play chess, e chimp will develop no science and he will exhibit no 
appreciation of beauty, f e grest part of man's wisdom may be traced
back to e eternal questions of beginnings and endings, e quest to give
meaning to his existence, to life itself.

Trouble always comes at e wrong time.

I opened dos f little old ladies, I helped e blind to see,
I got no friends 'cause ey read e papers, ey can't be seen,
Wi me, and I'm lin' real shot down,
And I'm, uh, lin' mean,
	No me, Mr. Nice Guy,
	No me, Mr. Clean,
	No me, Mr. Nice Guy,
y say "He's sick, he's obscene".

My dog bit me on e leg today, my cat  my eyes,
Ma's been rown out of e social circle, and Dad has to hide,
I went to church, incognito, when everybody rose,
 reverend Smiy, he recognized me,
And punched me in e nose, he said,
(chus)
He said "You're sick, you're obscene".
