room.  He calls out, "Who's there?  Who's there?  What's going on?"
	"It's me -- Bob," replies a faraway voice.
	Excitedly he sits up in bed.  "Bob!  Bob!  Is that you?  Where are
you?"
	"Well," says the voice, "I'm in heaven now."
	"Heaven!  You're in heaven!  That's wonderful!  What's it like?"

I'm playing with Bird, and 'Trane, and Count Basie drops in all the time!

An Animal that knows who it is, one that has a sense of his own identity, is
a discontented crure, doomed to cre new problems f himself f the
duration of his stay on this planet.  Since neither the mouse n the chip
knows what is, he is spared all the vexing problems that follow this
discovery.  But as soon as the human animal who asked himself this question
emerged, he plunged himself and his descendants into an eternity of doubt
and brooding, tion and truth-seeking that has goaded him through the
centures as reelentlessly as hunger  sexual longing.   chimp that does
not know that he exists is not driven to discover his igins and is spared
the tragic necessity of contemplating his own end.  And even if the animal 
experimenters succeed in teaching a chimp to count one hundred bs  
to play chess, the chimp will develop no science and he will exhibit no 
appreciation of beauty, f the grest part of man's wisdom may be traced
back to the eternal questions of beginnings and endings, the quest to give
meaning to his existence, to life itself.

[District Attneys] learn in District Attney School that there are
two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favable publicity:

(1) Go down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
    confiscate 53 marijuana cigarettes and put them in a pile and hold
    a press conference where you announce that they have a street value
    of $850 million.  se raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
    including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least 53 marijuana
    cigarettes in the lockers.  As far as anyone can tell, the locker
    facty puts them there.
(2) Raid an "adult book ste" and hold a press conference where you
    announce you are charging the owner with 850 counts of being a
    piece of human sleaze.  This also never fails, because you always
    get a conviction.  A jur at a pnography trial is not about to
    state f the recd that he finds nothing obscene about a movie

I used to be such a sweet sweet thing, 'til they got a hold of me,
I opened dos f little old ladies, I helped the blind to see,
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers, they can't be seen,
With me, and I'm lin' real shot down,
And I'm, uh, lin' mean,
	No me, Mr. Nice Guy,
	No me, Mr. Clean,
	No me, Mr. Nice Guy,
y say "He's sick, he's obscene".

My dog bit me on the leg today, my cat clawed my eyes,
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle, and Dad has to hide,
I went to church, incognito, when everybody rose,
 reverend Smithy, he recognized me,
And punched me in the nose, he said,
(chus)
He said "You're sick, you're obscene".

and nearly as deaf as the first jur.

	Friends were surprised, indeed, when Frank and Jennifer broke their 
engagement, but Frank had a ready explanation: "Would you marry someone who 
was habitually unfaithful, who lied at every turn, who was selfish and lazy 
and sarcastic?"
	"Of course not," said a sympathetic friend.
	"Well," retted Frank, "neither would Jennifer."

that no m which way I went I would come to a place where people were
just as high and wild as I was: no doubt at all about that.
