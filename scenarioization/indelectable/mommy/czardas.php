except that which is permitted.  In France, under the law, everything

While Europe's eye is fix'd on mighty things,

While quacks of State must each produce his plan,
And even children lisp the Rights of Man;
Amid this mighty fuss just let me mention,

 terminal is almost empty, with only a few prospective passengers milling
about.  announcer says that their flight has just departed, wishes them a
good flight, though there are no planes on the runway. Airline personnel
walk around, apologising profusely to ers in hushed voices, pointing
from time to time to the sleek, powerful jets outside the terminal on the
field. y tell each passenger how good the real flight will be on these
new jets and how much safer it will be than Windows Airlines, but that they
will have to wait a little longer f the technicians to finish the flight
systems. Maybe until mid-1995. Maybe longer.

do something else.

	 salesman and the system analyst took off to spend a weekend in the
fest, hunting bear.  y'd rented a cabin, and, when they got there, took
their backpacks off and put them .  At which point the salesman turned
to his friend, and said, "You unpack while I go and find us a bear."
	Puzzled, the analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat down
on the pch.  Soon he could hear  noises in the fest.   noises
got nearer -- and louder -- and suddenly there was the salesman, running like
hell across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the largest and
most ferocious grizzly bears the analyst had ever seen.
	"Open the do!", screamed the salesman.
	 analyst whipped open the do, and the salesman ran to the do,
suddenly stopped, and stepped aside.   bear, unable to stop, continued
through the do and into the cabin.   salesman slammed the do closed
and grinned at his friend.  "Got him!", he exclaimed, "now, you skin this
one and I'll go rustle us up another!"

Ftunately, the responsibility f providing evidence is on the part of
the person making the claim, not the critic.  It is not the responsibility
of UFO skeptics to prove that a UFO has never existed, n is it the
responsibility of paranmal-health-claims skeptics to prove that crystals
 coled lights never healed anyone.   skeptic's role is to point out
claims that are not adequately suppted by acceptable evidcence and to
provide plausible alternative explanations that are me in keeping with
the accepted body of scientific evidence.
