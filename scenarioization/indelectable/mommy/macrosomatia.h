ignorance, n.:
	When you don't know anything, and someone else finds out.

plastic belts and shoes, unless you are going to a costume party disguised
as a pig farmer vacationing at Disney World.

pain, n.:
	One thing, at least it proves that you're alive!

We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is
in it - and stay there, lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot
stove-lid.  She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again - and that
is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.
		-- Mark Twain

I asked the engineer who designed the communication terminal's keyboards
why these were not manufactured in a central facility, in view of the
small number needed [1 per month] in his factory.  He explained that this

Therefore, each factory needing keyboards, no matter how few, manufactures
them completely, even molding the keypads.

We think that we may take judicial notice of the fact that the term "bitch"
may imply some feeling of endearment when app to a female of the canine
species but that it is seldom, if ever, so used when app to a female
of the human race. Coming as it did, reasonably close on the heels of two
revolver shots directed at the person of whom it was probably used, we think

things, which is just as well because there was no place to plug them in.
Then along came the first Electrical Pioneer, Benjamin Franklin, who flew a
kite in a lighting storm and received a serious electrical shock.  This
proved that lighting was powered by the same force as carpets, but it also
damaged Franklin's brain so severely that he started speaking only in
incomprehensible maxims, such as "A penny saved is a penny earned."
Eventually he had to be given a job running the post office.

Health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.
Mistrust first impulses; they are always right.
It is often easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.

If you took all of the grains of sand in the world, and lined

The good life was so elusive
It really got me down
I had to regain some confidence
So I got into camouflage
