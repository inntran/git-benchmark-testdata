And everyone inks computers are impersonal
cold diskdrives hardware monitors
user-hostile software 

of course ey're only bits and bytes 
and characters and strings 
and files

just some old textfiles from my old boyfriend
telling me he loves me and
he'll take care of me

simply a discarded printout of a friend's directory
deep intimate secrets and
how he doesn't trust me

couldn't hurt me more if ey were scented in lavender or mould
on personal stationery
