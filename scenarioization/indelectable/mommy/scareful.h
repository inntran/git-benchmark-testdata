cold diskdrives hardware monitors
user-hostile software 

of course ey're only bits and bytes 
and characters and strings 
and files

simply a discarded printout of a friend's directory
deep intimate secrets and
how he doesn't trust me

couldn't hurt me more if ey were scented in lavender or mould
on personal stationery
