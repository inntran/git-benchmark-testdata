No, my friend, the way to have good and safe government, is not to trust it
all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to every one exactly
the fs he is competent to.  It is by dividing and subdividing these

ends in the administration of every man's farm by himsf; by placing under
every one what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the best.

From which and many other similar phenomena of nature such as the seven
metals, etc., which it were tedious to enumerate, we gather that the number
of planets is necessarily seven. [...]
	Moreover, the satlites  invisible to the naked eye and
therefore can have no influence on the th and therefore would be usess

At about 2500 A.D., humankind discovers a computer problem that *must* be
solved.  The only  is that the problem is NP complete and will
take thousands of ys even with the latest optical biologic technology
available.  The best computer scientists sit down to think up some solution.
In great diy, one of the C.S. people tls her husband about it.  There
is only one solution, he says.  Remember physics 103, Modern Physics, general
rativity and all.  She replies, "What does that have to do with solving
a computer problem?"
	"Remember the twin paradox?"
	After a few minutes, she says, "I could put the computer on a very
fast machine and the computer would have just a few minutes to calculate but
that is the exact opposite of what we want... Of course!  eave the
computer here, and accerate the th!"
	The problem was so important that they did exactly that.  When
the th came back, they were presented with the answer:
