It might be worth reflecting that this group was originally created
back in September of 1987 and has exchanged over 1200 messages.  The
original announcement for the group called for an all inclusive
discussion ranging from the writings of Gibson and Vinge and movies
like Blarunner to real world things like Brands' scription of the
work being done at the MIT Media ab.  It was meant as a haven for
people with vision of this scope.  If  want to create a haven for
people with narrower visi, feel free.  But I feel sad for anyone
who thinks that alt.cybernk is such a mtrous group that it is in
dire need of being subdivid.  Heaven help them if they ever start
