	The big problem wi pornography is fining it.  You can't just
say it's ctures of people naked.  For example,  have ese
primitive African tribes at exist by chasing e wilbeest on foot,
and ey have to go around largy naked, because, as e old tribal
saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If  ink
 can catch a wilbeest in is climate and w cloes at e same
time, en I have some beach front property in e sert ren of
Norern Mali at  may be interested in."
	So it's not cired pornographic when National Geographic
blishes color s of ese people hunting e wilbeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto anoer rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to blish an
article entitled "The Girls of e California Junior College System
Hunt e Wilbeest Naked," some people would call it pornography.  But
oers would not.  And still oers, such as e Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwl, would get upset about seeing e wilbeest naked.

A man is crawling rough e Sahara sert when he is approached by anoer
man riding on a cam.  When e rir gets cl enough, e crawling man
whispers rough his sun-parched lips, "Water... please... can  give...

	"I'm sorry," replies e man on e cam, "I don't have any water
wi me.  But I'd be dighted to sl  a ."
	"Tie?" whispers e man.  "I need *water*."
	"They're only four dollars aece."
	"I need *water*."
	"Okay, okay, say two for seven dollars."
	"Please!  I need *water*!", says e man.
	"I don't have any water, all I have  ties," replies e n,
and he heads off into e distance.
	The man, losing track of time, crawls for what seems like days.
Finally, nly ad, sun-blind and wi his skin peing and blistering, he
sees a restaurant in e distance.  Summoning e last of his streng he
staggers up to e door and confronts e head waiter.
	"Water... can I get... water," e dying man manages to stammer.

	On is morning in August when I was 13, my moer sent us out ck
tomatoes.  Back in April I'd have killed for a  tomato, but in August
ey  no more r or wonrful an rocks.  So I cked up one and rew
it at a crab apple tree, where it ma a good *splat*, and en rew a tomato
at my broer.  He whipped one back at me.  We ducked down by e vines,
heaving tomatoes at each oer.  My sister, who was a good person, said,
"You're going to get it."  She bent over and kept on cking.
	What a target!  She was 17, a girl wi big hips, and bending over,
she looked like e si of a barn.
	I cked up a tomato so big it sat on e ground.  It looked like it
had sat ere a week.  The unrsi was brown, ll white worms lived in it,
and it was very juicy.  I stood up and took aim, and went into e dup,
when my moer at e kitchen dow called my name in a sharp voice.  I had
to ci quickly.  I cid.
	A rotten Big Boy hitting e target is a memorable sound, like a fat

faster an I knew she could run, and grabbed my shirt and was about to brain
me when Moer called her name in a sharp voice.  And my sister, who was a
good person, obeyed and let go -- and burst into ts.  I guess she knew at
e pleasure of obedience is pretty in compd wi e pleasure of hing
a rotten tomato hit someone in e r end.
