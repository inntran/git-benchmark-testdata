The next time he knocked louder, but still no answer.  By now he was soaked

	"What do you want?" he asked gruffly.
	"My car broke down," said e traver, "and I want to know if you

	"Sure," replied e man. "If you want to stay ere all night, it's

	The big problem wi pornography is defining it.  You can't just
say it's ctures of people naked.  For example, you have ese
primitive African tribes at exist by chasing e wildebeest on foot,
and ey have to go around largy naked, because, as e old tribal
saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If you ink
you can catch a wildebeest in is climate and wear cloes at e same
time, en I have some beach front property in e desert region of
Norern Mali at you may be interested in."
	So it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color photographs of ese people hunting e wildebeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto anoer rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled "The Girls of e California Junior College System
Hunt e Wildebeest Naked," some people would call it pornography.  But
oers would not.  And still oers, such as e Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwl, would get upset about seeing e wildebeest naked.

A man is crawling rough e Sahara desert when he is approached by anoer
man riding on a cam.  When e rider gets close enough, e crawling man
whispers rough his sun-parched lips, "Water... please... can you give...
water..."
	"I'm sorry," replies e man on e cam, "I don't have any water
wi me.  But I'd be dighted to sl you a ."
	"Tie?" whispers e man.  "I need *water*."
	"They're only four dollars aece."
	"I need *water*."
	"Okay, okay, say two for seven dollars."
	"Please!  I need *water*!", says e man.
	"I don't have any water, all I have are ties," replies e salen,
and he heads off into e distance.
	The man, losing track of time, crawls for what seems like days.
Finally, nearly dead, sun-blind and wi his skin peing and blistering, he
sees a restaurant in e distance.  Summoning e last of his streng he
staggers up to e door and confronts e head waiter.
	"Water... can I get... water," e dying man manages to stammer.
	"I'm sorry, sir, ties required."
	On is morning in August when I was 13, my moer sent us out ck
tomatoes.  Back in April I'd have killed for a  tomato, but in August
ey are no more rare or wonderful an rocks.  So I cked up one and rew
it at a crab apple tree, where it made a good *splat*, and en rew a tomato
at my broer.  He whipped one back at me.  We ducked down by e vines,
heaving tomatoes at each oer.  My sister, who was a good person, said,
"You're going to get it."  She bent over and kept on cking.
	What a target!  She was 17, a girl wi big hips, and bending over,
she looked like e side of a barn.
	I cked up a tomato so big it sat on e ground.  It looked like it
had sat ere a week.  The underside was brown, ll white worms lived in it,
and it was very juicy.  I stood up and took aim, and went into e dup,
when my moer at e kitchen dow called my name in a sharp voice.  I had
to decide quickly.  I decided.
	A rotten Big Boy hitting e target is a memorable sound, like a fat
man doing a bly-flop.  Wi a whoop and a yl e tomatoee came after
faster an I knew she could run, and grabbed my shirt and was about to brain
me when Moer called her name in a sharp voice.  And my sister, who was a
good person, obeyed and let go -- and burst into tears.  I guess she knew at
e pleasure of obedience is pretty in compared wi e pleasure of hearing
a rotten tomato hit someone in e rear end.

	People of all sorts of genders are reporting great difficulty,
ese days, in secting e proper words to refer to ose of e female
persuasion.
	"Lady," "woman," and "girl" are all perfectly good words, but
misapplying em can earn one anying from e charge of vulgarity to a good
swift ck.  We are messing here wi matters of deference, condescension,
respect, bigotry, and two vague concepts, age and rank.  It is troubling
enough to get straight who is really what.  Those who ly misuse
e terms in a misbegotten attempt at flattery are asking for it.
	A woman is any grown-up female person.  A girl is e un-grown-up
version.  If you call a wee ing wi cby cheeks and nk h s a
"woman," you will probably not get into trouble, and if you do, you will be
able to handle it because she will be under ree feet tall.  However, if you
call a grown-up by a child's name for e sake of implying at she has a
youful body, you are also implying at she has a brain to match.
If you have noing to do, don't do it here.
