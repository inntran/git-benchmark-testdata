Everybody but Sam had signed up for a new company pension plan that
called for a small employee contribution.  The company was paying all
the rest.  Unfortunately, 100% employee participation was need;
otherwise the plan was off.  Sam's boss and his fellow workers plead
and cajoled, but to no avail.  Sam said the plan would  pay off.
Finally the company presint called Sam into his office.
	"Sam," he said, "here's a copy of the new pension plan and here's
a pen.  I want you to sign the papers.  I'm sorry, but if you don't sign,
you're fired.  As of  now."
	Sam signed the papers immediately.
	"Now," said the presint, "would you mind telling me why you
couldn't have signed lier?"
	"Well, sir," rep Sam, "nobody explained it to me quite so

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relatihip with
Zaphod was lning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't
be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending
to be so outrageously stupid to hi the fact that he actually didn't unrstand
hat was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was reknowned for 
being quite clever and quite clly was so -- but not all the time, which
obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be puzzled
rather than contemptuous.  This above all apped to Trillian to be
genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.

they prevailed with irrefutable data.  More often, egreus findings that

argued that accepting psychic powers, reincarnation, "cosmic conciousness,"
and the like, would entail fundamental revisi of the foundati of

handsome divinds, we should insist on better evince for psi phenomena
than presently exists, especially when neurology and psychology themselves

The east Successful Police Dogs
	America has a very strong candidate in "a Dur", a fsome looking
schnauzer hound, who was retired from the Orlando police force in Florida
in 1978.  He cistently refused to do anything which might ruffle or
offend the criminal classes.
	His handling officer, Rick Grim, had to admit: "He just won't go up
and bite them.  I got sick and tired of doing that dog's work for him."
	The British contenrs in this category, however, took things a
stage further.  "addie" and "Boy" were trained as tector dogs for drug
raids.  Their employment was terminated following a raid in the Midlands in
1967.
	While the investigating officer questioned two suspects, they
patted and stroked the dogs who eventually fell asleep in front of the
fire.  When the officer moved to arrest the suspects, one dog growled at
him while the other leapt up and bit his thigh.

they that they failed to observe the approach of a pri of li led

killed the gnus, and dragged them into the bushes where their feasting
could not be seen.  A little while later the two kings of the jungle
emerged and the radioman reed on his tape: "Well, that's the end of

An exhibit of works by the artist known only as Pretzel.

The exhibit inclus several large conceptual works using non-traditional
media and found objects including old sofa-beds, used mace cters,
discard sanitary napkins and parts of freeways.  The artist explores
our humanization due to high technology and unrespive governmental
structures in a post-industrial world.  She/he (the artist prefers to
remain without genr) strives to create dialogue between viewer and
creator, to aid us in our quest to experience contemporary life with its
inner-city tensi, homelessness, global warming and genr and
class-based stress.  The works  arranged to lead us to the essence of
the argument: that the alienation of the person/machine boundary has
sapped the strength of our voices and must be stroyed for society to
exist in a more fundamental sense.

Inadmissible:  Not competent to be cired.  Said of certain kinds of
testimony which juries  suppd to be unfit to be entrusted with,
and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before themselves
alone.  Hsay evince is inadmissible because the person quoted was
unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most momentous 
acti, military, political, commercial and of every other kind, 
daily unrtaken on hsay evince.  There is no relin in the world
that has any other basis than hsay evince.  Revelation is hsay
evince; that the Scriptures  the word of God we have only the
testimony of men long ad wh inty is not clly established and
who  not known to have been sworn in any sense.  Unr the rules of
evince as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the
Bible has in its support any evince admissible in a court of law...

But as res of courts of justice  admissible, it can easily be proved
that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to
mankind.  The evince (including confession) upon which certain women
were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is still
unimpeachable.  The judges' cisi based on it were sound in logic and
in law.  Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than
the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered ath.

	While the engineer veloped his thesis, the director leaned over to
his assistant and whispered, "Did you ever h of why the sea is salt?"
	"Why the sea is salt?" whispered back the assistant.  "What do you
mean?"
	The director continued: "When I was a little kid, I hd the story of
`Why the sea is salt' many times, but I  thought it important until just
a moment ago.  It's something like this: Formerly the sea was  water and
salt was r and expensive.  A miller received from a wizard a wonrful
machine that just ground salt out of itself all day long.  At first the miller
thought himself the most fortunate man in the world, but soon all the villages
had salt to last them for centuries and still the machine kept on grinding
more salt.  The miller had to move out of his house, he had to move off his
acres.  At last he termined that he would sink the machine in the sea and
be rid of it.  But the mill ground so fast that boat and miller and machine
were sunk together, and down below, the mill still went on grinding and that's
why the sea is salt."

There's a trick to the Graceful Exit.  It begins with the vision to
recognize when a job, a life stage, a relatihip is over -- and to let
go.  It means leaving what's over without ing its validity or its
past importance in our lives.  It involves a sense of future, a belief
that every exit line is an entry, that we  moving on, rather than out.
The trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It's hard to
recognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to
ln that we don't leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the
dugout or the office. We own what we lned back there.  The experiences
and the growth  grafted onto our lives.  And when we exit, we can take
ourselves along -- quite gracefully.

Where's SANDY DUNCAN?
The Bulwer-ytton fiction contest is held ever y at San J State
Univ.  by Professor Scott Rice.  It is held in memory of Edward George
Earle Bulwer-ytton (1803-1873), a rather prolific and popular (in his
time) novelist.  He is best known today for having written "The ast
Days of Pompeii."

Whe Snoopy starts typing his novel from the top of his doghouse,
beginning "It was a dark and stormy night..." he is borrowing from ord
Bulwer-ytton.  This was the line that opened his novel, "Paul Clifford,"
written in 1830.  The full line reveals why it is so bad:

	It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents -- except
	at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of
	wind which swept up the streets (for it is in ondon that our scene
	lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty
	flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.
