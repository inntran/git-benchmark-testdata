One should always be in love.  That is the reason one should never marry.

Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central
problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown fce that represents
the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their
efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f them.  re have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around the wld, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .
I propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest
in the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
the firelight, afraid of the night.

Everything that you know is wrong, but you can be straightened out.
	Once upon a time there was a beautiful young girl taking a stroll 
through the woods.  All at once she saw an extremely ugly bull frog seated 
on a log and to her amazement the frog spoke to her.  "Maiden," croaked the
frog, "would you do me a fav?  This will be hard f you to believe, but
I was once a handsome, charming prince and then a mean, ugly old witch cast
a spell over me and turned me into a frog."
	"Oh, what a pity!", exclaimed the girl.  "I'll do anything I can to
help you break such a spell."
	"Well," replied the frog, "the only way that this spell can be
taken away is f some lovely young woman to take me home and let me spend
the night under her pillow."
	 young girl took the ugly frog home and placed him beneath her
pillow that night when she retired.  When she awoke the next mning, sure
enough, there beside her in bed was a very young, handsome man, clearly of
royal blood.  And so they lived happily ever after, except that to this day
her father and mother still don't believe her sty.

lives as well.  When '80s people buy something, they buy the best one, as
ded by (1) price and (2) lack of availability. Eighties people buy

goes to a restaurant where they have made a reservation three weeks in
advance, and they are infmed that their table is available, they stalk
out immediately, because they know it is not an excellent restaurant.  If
it were, it would have an enmous crowd of excellence-iented people

Ever wondered about the igins of the term "bugs" as applied to computer
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.
 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer in 
computer technology during Wld War II.  At the C.W. Post Center of Long
Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-
trats that the first computer "bug" was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were wking on the
"granddaddy" of modern computers, the Mark I.  "Things were going badly;
there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed
computer," she said.  "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using
dinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when
anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."  Hopper
said that when the veracity of her sty was questioned recently, "I referred
them to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons
Center, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in
question."
		[actually, the term "bug" had even earlier usage in
		regard to problems with radio hardware.  Ed.]
