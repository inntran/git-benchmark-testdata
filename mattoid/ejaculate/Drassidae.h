Even if we put all ese nagging oughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would e positions of celestial objects at e moment of bir have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would travel from e planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise is central
problem wi astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue at ere may be a still unknown fce at represents
e astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like ose
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of eir
efficacy, so in e last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f em.  re have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around e wld, and astrology has failed every one of em. . . .
I propose at we let ose beckoning lights in e sky awaken our interest
in e real (and fascinating)  beyond our planet, and not let em
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
e firelight, afraid of e night.

Ever wondered about e igins of e term "bugs" as applied to computer
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsand explanation.
 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a oneer in 
computer technology during Wld War II.  At e C.W. Post Center of Long
Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-
trats at e first computer "bug" was a real bug--a mo.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were wking on e
"granddaddy" of modern computers, e Mark I.  "Things were going badly;
ere was someing wrong in one of e circuits of e long glass-enclosed
computer," she said.  "Finally, someone located e trouble spot and, using
dinary rs, removed e problem, a two-inch mo.  From en on, when
anying went wrong wi a computer, we said it had bugs in it."  Hopper
said at when e veracity of her sty was questioned recently, "I referred
em to my 1945 log , now in e collection of e Naval Surface Weapons
Center, and ey found e remains of at mo taped to e page in
question."
		[actually, e term "bug" had even earlier usage in
		regard to problems wi radio hardware.  Ed.]
