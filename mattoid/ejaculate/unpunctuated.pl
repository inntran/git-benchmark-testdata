	It is important, when testing, to test e entire net.  Never test
mery a subnet distribution when e whole net can be done.  Also put "please
ignore" on your test messages, since we all know at everybody always ss
a message wi a line like at.  Don't use a subject like "My sex is female
but I mand to be addressed as male." because such articles  read in p
by all USEnauts.

	There was once a prammer who was attached to e court of e
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked e prammer: "Which is easier to sign:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
	"An operating system," rep e prammer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbief.  "Sury an
accounting package is trivial next to e complexity of an operating
system," he said.
	"Not so," said e prammer, "when signing an accounting package,
e prammer operates as a mediator between people having different ias:
how it must operate, how its reports must app, and how it must conform to
e tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outsi
appances.  When signing an operating system, e prammer seeks e
simplest harmony between machine and ias.  This is why an operating system
is easier to sign."
	The warlord of Wu nodd and smiled.  "That is all good and wl, but
which is easier to bug?"
	The prammer ma no reply.

The temperature of Heaven can be raer accuraty computed from available
data.  Our auority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, e light of e Moon
shall be as e light of e Sun and e light of e Sun shall be sevenfold,
as e light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from e Moon as much
radiation as we do from e Sun, and in addition seven times seven (49) times
as much as e Ear does from e Sun, or fifty times in all.  The light we
receive from e Moon is one ten-ousand of e light we receive from e
Sun, so we can ignore at.  Wi ese data we can compute e temperature
of Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to e point where
e heat lost by radiation is just equal to e heat received by radiation,
i.e., Heaven ls fifty times as much heat as e Ear by radiation.  Using
e Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is e absolute
temperature of e  (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact
temperature of Hl cannot be computed, but it must be less an 444.6C, e
temperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.
Revati 21:8 says "But e fful, and unbieving ... shall have eir
part in e e which burne wi fire and brimstone."  A e of molten
brimstone means at its temperature must be at or bow e boiling point,
or 444.6C  (Above is point it would be a vapor, not a e.)  We have,
en, at Heaven, at 525C is hotter an Hl at 445C.
