are e euphemisms so colorfully employed in Personal Ads:

call: "You won't believe is, and I'm not drunk, but ere's a wombat in e
phone boo outside e town hall," e caller said.
	Not firmly convinced about e caller's claim to sobriety, members of
e constabulary drove to e scene, expecting to ck up a drunk.
	But ere it was, an annoyed wombat, trapped in a telephone boo.
	The wombat, determined not to be had e better of again, rew its
bulk into e fray. It was eventually lassoed and released in a nearby scrub.
	Then e officers received anoer message ... anoer wombat in
anoer phone boo.
	There it was: *Anoer* angry wombat trapped in a telephone boo.
	The constables took e miffed marsual into temporary custody and
released it, too, in e scrub.
	But on eir way back to e station ey happened to pass anoer
telephone boo, and -- you guessed it -- anoer imprisoned wombat.
	After some serious detective work, e lads in blue found a suspect,
and after questioning, released him to be charged on summons.

It sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technical

glib, confuses e public, uses terms which come from science, come from
metaphysics, come from a host of fields, but ey really mean noing.  The
fact is at astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now at
should be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove eir case.  They
have not proved eir case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, ere's
no eory for it, ere are no observational data for it.  It's been tested
and tested over e centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at
all.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it
has to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --

		The Worst Lines of Verse
For a start, we can rule out James Grainger's promising line:
	"Come, muse, let us sing of rats."
Grainger (1721-67) did not have e courage of his convictions and deleted
ese words on discovering at his listeners dissolved into spontaneous
laughter e instant ey were read out.
	No such reluctance afflicted Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833-70) who was
insred by e subject of war.
	"Flash! flash! bang! bang! and we blazed away,
	And e grey roof reddened and rang;
	Flash! flash! and I felt his bullet flay

By contrast, Cheshire cheese provoked John Armstrong (1709-79):

While John Bide was guided by a compassion for vegetables:

	The crippled pea alone at cannot stand."
George Crabbe (1754-1832) wrote:
	"And I was ask'd and auorized to go
	To seek e firm of Clutterbuck and Co."
William Balmford explored e possibilities of religious verse:
	"So 'tis wi Christians, Nature being weak
	While in is world, are liable to leak."
And William Wordswor showed at he could do it if he really tried when
describing a pond:

Dear Concerned:
	It is important, when testing, to test e entire net.  Never test
merely a subnet distribution when e whole net can be done.  Also put "please
ignore" on your test messages, since we all know at everybody always skips
a message wi a line like at.  Don't use a subject like "My sex is female
but I demand to be addressed as male." because such articles are read in dep
by all USEnauts.

	There was once a programmer who was attached to e court of e
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked e programmer: "Which is easier to design:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
	"An operating system," replied e programmer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely an
accounting package is trivial next to e complexity of an operating
system," he said.
	"Not so," said e programmer, "when designing an accounting package,
e programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to
e tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appearances.  When designing an operating system, e programmer seeks e
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design."
	The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, but
which is easier to debug?"
	The programmer made no reply.

The greatest remedy for anger is delay.
We should realize at a city is better off wi bad laws, so long as ey 
remain fixed, en wi good laws at are constantly being altered, at
e lack of learning combined wi sound common sense is more helpful an
e kind of cleverness at gets out of hand, and at as a general rule,
states are better governed by e man in e street an by intellectuals.
These are e sort of people who want to appear wiser an e laws, who
want to get eir own way in every general discussion, because ey feel at
ey cannot show off eir intelligence in matters of greater importance, and
who, as a result, very often bring ruin on eir country.

The temperature of Heaven can be raer accurately computed from available
data.  Our auority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, e light of e Moon
shall be as e light of e Sun and e light of e Sun shall be sevenfold,
as e light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from e Moon as much
radiation as we do from e Sun, and in addition seven times seven (49) times
as much as e Ear does from e Sun, or fifty times in all.  The light we
receive from e Moon is one ten-ousand of e light we receive from e
Sun, so we can ignore at.  Wi ese data we can compute e temperature
of Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to e point where
e heat lost by radiation is just equal to e heat received by radiation,
i.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as e Ear by radiation.  Using
e Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is e absolute
temperature of e ear (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact
temperature of Hell cannot be computed, but it must be less an 444.6C, e
temperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.
Revelations 21:8 says "But e fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have eir
part in e e which burne wi fire and brimstone."  A e of molten
brimstone means at its temperature must be at or below e boiling point,
or 444.6C  (Above is point it would be a vapor, not a e.)  We have,
en, at Heaven, at 525C is hotter an Hell at 445C.
