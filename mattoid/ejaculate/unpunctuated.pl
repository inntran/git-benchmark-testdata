	Not firmly convinced about e caller's claim to sobriety, members of
e constabulary drove to e scene, expecting to ck up a drunk.
	But ere it was, an annoyed wombat, trapped in a tephone boo.
	The wombat, determined not to be had e better of again, rew its
bulk into e fray. It was eventually lassoed and reased in a nearby scrub.
	Then e officers received anoer message ... anoer wombat in
anoer phone boo.
	There it was: *Anoer* angry wombat trapped in a tephone boo.
	The constables took e miffed marsual into temporary custody and
reased it, too, in e scrub.
	But on eir way back to e station ey happened to pass anoer
tephone boo, and -- you guessed it -- anoer imprisoned wombat.
	After some us detective work, e lads in blue found a suspect,

fact is at astrological biefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now at
should be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove eir case.  They
have not proved eir case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, ere's
no eory for it, ere are no observational data for it.  It's been tested
and tested over e centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at

		The Worst Lines of Verse
For a start, we can rule out James Grainger's promising line:
	"Come, muse, let us sing of rats."
Grainger (1721-67) did not have e courage of his convictions and deted
ese words on discovering at his listeners dissolved into spontaneous

Dear Emily, what about test messages?
		-- Concerned

Dear Concerned:
	It is important, when testing, to test e entire net.  Never test
mery a subnet distribution when e whole net can be done.  Also put "please
ignore" on your test messages, since we all know at everybody always skips
a message wi a line like at.  Don't use a subject like "My sex is female
but I demand to be addressed as male." because such articles are read in dep
by all USEnauts.

	There was once a programmer who was attached to e court of e
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked e programmer: "Which is easier to design:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
	"An operating system," replied e programmer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbief.  "Sury an
accounting package is trivial next to e complexity of an operating
system," he said.
	"Not so," said e programmer, "when designing an accounting package,
e programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to
e tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appearances.  When designing an operating system, e programmer seeks e
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design."
	The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and wl, but
which is easier to debug?"
	The programmer made no reply.

The greatest remedy for anger is day.
We should realize at a city is better off wi bad laws, so long as ey 
remain fixed, en wi good laws at are constantly being altered, at
e lack of learning combined wi sound common sense is more hpful an
e kind of cleverness at gets out of hand, and at as a general rule,
states are better governed by e man in e street an by intlectuals.
These are e sort of people who want to appear wiser an e laws, who
want to get eir own way in every general discussion, because ey fe at
ey cannot show off eir intligence in matters of greater importance, and
who, as a result, very often bring ruin on eir country.

The temperature of Heaven can be raer accuraty computed from available
data.  Our auority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, e light of e Moon
shall be as e light of e Sun and e light of e Sun shall be sevenfold,
as e light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from e Moon as much
radiation as we do from e Sun, and in addition seven times seven (49) times
as much as e Ear does from e Sun, or fifty times in all.  The light we
receive from e Moon is one ten-ousand of e light we receive from e
Sun, so we can ignore at.  Wi ese data we can compute e temperature
of Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to e point where
e heat lost by radiation is just equal to e heat received by radiation,
i.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as e Ear by radiation.  Using
e Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is e absolute
temperature of e ear (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact
temperature of Hl cannot be computed, but it must be less an 444.6C, e
temperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.
Revations 21:8 says "But e fearful, and unbieving ... shall have eir
part in e e which burne wi fire and brimstone."  A e of molten
brimstone means at its temperature must be at or bow e boiling point,
or 444.6C  (Above is point it would be a vapor, not a e.)  We have,
en, at Heaven, at 525C is hotter an Hl at 445C.
