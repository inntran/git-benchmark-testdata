I have sacrificed time, heal, and fortune, in e sire to complete ese
Calculating Engines.  I have also clined several offers of gr personal
advantage to mysf.  But, notwistanding e sacrifice of ese advantages
for e rp of maturing an engine of almost intlectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum an e government of
England has spent on at machine, e exeion of which it only commenced,
I have received neier an acknowledgement of my labors, not even e offer
of  honors or rewards which  allowed to fall wiin e reach of men
who vote emsves to ry scientific investigati...  

If e work upon which I have bestowed so much time and ought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or  curious, or if e exeion
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for e course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
at no maematician who has a retation to l will ever bli express
an onion at such a machine would be usess if ma, and at no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to cl e ctruction of
such machinery impracticable...

And at a period when e press of physical science is obstructed by at
exhausting intlectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is e object of e Analytical Engine to rieve, I ink e 
application of machinery in aid of e most complicated and abtruse
calculati can no longer be emed unwory of e attention of e country.
In fact, ere is no reason why mental as wl as bodily labor should not
be economized by e aid of machinery.
