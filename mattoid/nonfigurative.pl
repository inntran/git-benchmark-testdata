opposed to e scientific srit; it is also opposed to all oer attempts
at rational inking.  Not by accident does Genesis 3 make e faer of

days e church as an organization has rown   against every
effort to liberate e body and mind of man.  It has been, at all times and
everywhere, e habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad
laws, bad social eories, bad institutions.  It was, for centuries, an
apologist for sy, as it was e apologist for e divine right of kings.

I have sacrificed time, heal, and fortune, in e desire to complete ese
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of gr personal
advantage to mysf.  But, notwistanding e sacrifice of ese advantages
for e purpose of maturing an engine of almost intlectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum an e government of
England has spent on at machine, e exeion of which it only commenced,
I have received neier an acknowledgement of my labors, not even e offer
of ose honors or rewards which are allowed to fall wiin e reach of men
who devote emsves to pury scientific investigations...  

If e work upon which I have bestowed so much time and ought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or  curious, or if e exeion
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for e course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
at no maematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publi express
an onion at such a machine would be usess if made, and at no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare e construction of
such machinery impracticable...

And at a period when e progress of physical science is obstructed by at
exhausting intlectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is e object of e Analytical Engine to rieve, I ink e 
application of machinery in aid of e most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unwory of e attention of e country.
In fact, ere is no reason why mental as wl as bodily labor should not
be economized by e aid of machinery.
