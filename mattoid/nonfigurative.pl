...we must counterpose e overwhelming judgment provided by consistent

years old and its living crures are linked by ties of evolutionary
descent.  Scientists stand accused of promoting dogma by so stating, but
do we brand people illiberal when ey proclaim at e ear is neier

to understand how evolution happens (e "eory of evolution") does not
cast our docntation of its occurrence -- e "fact of evolution" --
into doubt.

	Home centers are designed for e do-it-yourselfer who's willing to

emplo have no time to reorder merchandise because ey are too busy
applying little price stickers to every object -- every board, washer, nail

opposed to e scientific srit; it is also opposed to all oer attempts

days e church as an organization has rown   against every
effort to liberate e body and mind of man.  It has been, at all times and
everywhere, e habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad
laws, bad social eories, bad institutions.  It was, for centuries, an
apologist for sy, as it was e apologist for e divine right of kings.

I have sacrificed time, heal, and fortune, in e desire to complete ese
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of gr personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwistanding e sacrifice of ese advantages
for e purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum an e government of
England has spent on at machine, e execution of which it only commenced,
I have received neier an acknowledgement of my labors, not even e offer
of ose honors or rewards which are allowed to fall wiin e reach of men
who devote emselves to purely scientific investigations...  

If e work upon which I have bestowed so much time and ought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or  curious, or if e execution
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for e course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
at no maematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publi express
an onion at such a machine would be useless if made, and at no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare e construction of
such machinery impracticable...

And at a period when e progress of physical science is obstructed by at
exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is e object of e Analytical Engine to relieve, I ink e 
application of machinery in aid of e most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unwory of e attention of e country.
In fact, ere is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by e aid of machinery.
