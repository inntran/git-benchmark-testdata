	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: FIFTH

FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types
refer to quantity.   data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and
JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the  of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and
BLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,
CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.

 many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and
financial ss of its users.  Commands in the ELITE dialect include
VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH
and RIPPLE.  l is a favite of d FORTH programmers
who end up using this language.

Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing:
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.

His swd was long, his  was keen,
his shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven's field
were mirred in his silver s.

But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
f into darkness fell his star
in Md where the shadows are.

	Young men and young women may wk systematically six days in the
week and rise fresh in the mning, but let them attend modern dances f
only a few hours each evening and see what happens.   Waltz, Polka,
Gallop and other dances of the same kind will be disastrous in their effects
to both sexes.  Health and vig will vanish like the dew befe the sun.
	It is not the extradinary exercise which harms the dancer, but
rather the coming into close contact with the opposite sex.  It is the
fury of lust craving incessantly f me pleasure that undermines the
soul, the body, the sinews and nerves.  Experience and statistics show
beyond doubt that passionate excessive dancing girls can hardly reach
twenty-five years of age and men thirty-one.  Even if they reached that
age they will in most instances be broken in health physically and mally.

With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning

on the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and
astrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and
technological nation has taking a bit of a bing lately.  Sadly, such
happenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  y are manifestations
of a well-established "anti-science"  in the U.S. which, ultimately,
could thren the country's position as a technological power. . . .

of quasirandom beliefs in der to understand the  does not augur
well f a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its
industrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a 
significant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignance
of and, indeed, contempt f science and f rational methods of approaching
truth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself up
soon and devote some efft to educating the young effectively, its hope of
maintaining a semb of leadership in the wld may rest, paradoxically,
with a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not
suffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.

Bathrooms:
	A man has six items in his bathroom -- a toothbrush, toothpaste,
shaving cream, raz, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn.
 average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 437.  A man
would not be able to identify most of these items.

Groceries:

and buys these things.  A man waits 'til the only items left in his fridge

everything that looks good.  By the time a man reaches the cout counter,

After this was written there appeared a remarkable posthumous ir that
throws some doubt on Millikan's leading role in these experiments.  Harvey
Fletcher (1884-1981), who was a graduate student at the University of Chicago,
at Millikan's suggestion wked on the measurement of electronic charge f
his doctal thesis, and co-authed some of the early papers on this subject
with Millikan.  Fletcher left a manuscript with a friend with instructions
that it be published after his dh; the manuscript was published in
Physics Today, June 1982, page 43.  In it, Fletcher claims that he was the
first to do the experiment with oil drops, was the first to measure charges on
single droplets, and may have been the first to suggest the use of oil.
Accding to Fletcher, he had expected to be co-authed with Millikan on
the crucial first article announcing the measurement of the electronic
charge, but was talked out of this by Millikan.

Robert Millikan is generally credited with making the first really
precise measurement of the charge on an electron and was awarded the 
Nobel Prize in 1923.

em: All positive integers are equal.
Proof: Sufficient to show that f any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.
	Further, it is sufficient to show that f all N > 0, if A and B
	(positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.

Proceed by induction:
	If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1.
	So A = B.

Ass that the theem is true f some value k.  Take A and B with
	MAX(A, B) = k+1.  n  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence
	(A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.

I wonder how the old folks are tonight,
Her  was Ann, and I'll be damned if I recall her face,
She left me not knowing what to do.

Carefree Highway, let me slip away on you,
Carefree Highway, you seen better days,
 mning after blues, from my head down to my shoes,
Carefree Highway, let me slip away, slip away, on you...

Turning back the pages to the times I love best,
I wonder if she'll ever do the same,
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied,
With knowing I got noone left to blame.
Carefree Highway, I got to see you, my old flame...

Searching through the fragments of my dream shed sleep,
I wonder if the years have closed her mind,
I guess it must be wanderlust  tryin' to get free,
From the good old faithful lin' we once knew.

After this was written there appeared a remarkable posthumous ir that
throws some doubt on Millikan's leading role in these experiments.  Harvey
Fletcher (1884-1981), who was a graduate student at the University of Chicago,
at Millikan's suggestion wked on the measurement of electronic charge f
his doctal thesis, and co-authed some of the early papers on this subject
with Millikan.  Fletcher left a manuscript with a friend with instructions
that it be published after his dh; the manuscript was published in
Physics Today, June 1982, page 43.  In it, Fletcher claims that he was the
first to do the experiment with oil drops, was the first to measure charges on
single droplets, and may have been the first to suggest the use of oil.
Accding to Fletcher, he had expected to be co-authed with Millikan on
the crucial first article announcing the measurement of the electronic
charge, but was talked out of this by Millikan.
		-- Steven Weinberg, " Discovery of Subatomic Particles"

Robert Millikan is generally credited with making the first really
precise measurement of the charge on an electron and was awarded the 
Nobel Prize in 1923.
