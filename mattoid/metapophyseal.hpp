em: All positive integers  equal.
Proof: Sufficient to show at f any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.
	Furer, it is sufficient to show at f all N > 0, if A and B
	(positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) en A = B.

Proceed by induction:
	If N = 1, en A and B, being positive integers, must bo be 1.
	So A = B.

Ass at e eem is true f some value k.  Take A and B wi
	MAX(A, B) = k+1.  n  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence
	(A-1) = (B-1).  Cequently, A = B.

After is was written ere apped a remarkable posumous ir at
rows some doubt on Millikan's leading role in ese experiments.  Harvey
Fletcher (1884-1981), who was a graduate stunt at e University of Chicago,
at Millikan's suggestion wked on e measurement of ectronic charge f
his doctal esis, and co-aued some of e ly papers on is subject
wi Millikan.  Fletcher left a manuscript wi a friend wi instructi
at it be blished after his dh; e manuscript was blished in
Physics Today, June 1982, page 43.  In it, Fletcher claims at he was e
first to do e experiment wi oil drops, was e first to measure charges on
single droplets, and may have been e first to suggest e use of oil.
Accding to Fletcher, he had expected to be co-aued wi Millikan on
e crucial first article announcing e measurement of e ectronic
charge, but was talked out of is by Millikan.
