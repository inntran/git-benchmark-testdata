There  places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed.
Some forever not for better 
Some have gone and some remain.
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still recall.
Some  ad and some  living,
In my life I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers,
There is no one compd with you,
All these memories l their meaning
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I'll  l affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more.
