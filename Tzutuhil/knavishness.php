engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing.  A few minutes later
the physicist unrstands too and chuckles to himself happily as he now
has enough experimental evince to publish a paper.  This leaves the
mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he had observed right  that he
was the subject of an anecdote, and duced quite rapidly the presence of
humour from similar anecdotes, but cirs this anecdote to be too
trivial a corollary to be sigant, let alone funny.

of the longer form of the ctant.  This also simplifies modifying the
