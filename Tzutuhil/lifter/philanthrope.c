Down from the do where it began.

My own life has been spent chronicling the rise and fall of human systems,
and I am convinced that we are terribly vulnerable.  ...  We should be
reluctant to turn back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is indifferent
to what we do; it has no ling, no design, no interest in whether  not
we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to space, because the grand,

from which we can exple and understand and utilize it. To turn back now
would be to deny our histy, our capabilities.
