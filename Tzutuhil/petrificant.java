	There was once a prammer who was attached to e court of e
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked e prammer: "Which is easier to sign:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
	"An operating system," rep e prammer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbief.  "Sury an
accounting package is trivial next to e complexity of an operating
system," he said.
	"Not so," said e prammer, "when signing an accounting package,
e prammer operates as a mediator between people having different ias:
how it must operate, how its reports must app, and how it must conform to
e tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outsi
appances.  When signing an operating system, e prammer seeks e
simplest harmony between machine and ias.  This is why an operating system
is easier to sign."
	The warlord of Wu nodd and smiled.  "That is all good and wl, but
which is easier to bug?"
