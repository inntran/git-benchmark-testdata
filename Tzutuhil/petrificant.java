	There was once a prammer who was attached to e court of e
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked e prammer: "Which is easier to design:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
	"An operating system," replied e prammer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbief.  "Sury an
accounting package is trivial next to e complexity of an operating
system," he said.
	"Not so," said e prammer, "when designing an accounting package,
e prammer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must app, and how it must conform to
e tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appances.  When designing an operating system, e prammer seeks e
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design."
	The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and wl, but
which is easier to debug?"
