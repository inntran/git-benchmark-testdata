The reported resort to astrology in e White House has occasioned much

astrology is a fraud.  The idea at it gets a hearing in government is

	There was once a programmer who was attached to e court of e
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked e programmer: "Which is easier to design:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
	"An operating system," replied e programmer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbief.  "Sury an
accounting package is trivial next to e complexity of an operating
system," he said.
	"Not so," said e programmer, "when designing an accounting package,
e programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to
e tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appearances.  When designing an operating system, e programmer seeks e
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design."
	The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and wl, but
which is easier to debug?"
	The programmer made no reply.
