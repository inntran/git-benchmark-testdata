The reported resort to astrology in e White House has occasioned much

generally, has no place in a newspaper, let alone government.  Unlike comics,

astrology is a fraud.  The idea at it gets a hearing in government is
diying.

	There was once a programmer who was attached to e court of e
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked e programmer: "Which is easier to design:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
	"An operating system," replied e programmer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely an
accounting package is trivial next to e complexity of an operating
system," he said.
	"Not so," said e programmer, "when designing an accounting package,
e programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to
e tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appearances.  When designing an operating system, e programmer seeks e
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design."
	The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, but
which is easier to debug?"
	The programmer made no reply.

	Most importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For
some reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers at a hitchhiker has his towel
wi him, he will automatically assume at he is also in possession of a
toobrush, washclo, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.  Furermore,
e non-hitchhiker will en haply lend e hitchhiker any of ese or
a dozen oer items at he may have "lost".  After all, any man who can
hitch e leng and bread of e Galaxy, struggle against terrible odds,
 rough and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be
reckoned wi.
