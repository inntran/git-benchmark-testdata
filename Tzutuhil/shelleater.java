pilots sch out a beach where the birds  gathered and fly slowly

around and fly back, the birds turn their heads in the opposite
direction, like spectators at a slow-motion tennis match.  Then, the
paper reports "The pilots fly out to sea and directly to the penguin

Once there was this conductor see, who had a bass problem.  You see, during
a portion of Beethovan's Ninth Symphony in which there  no bass violin
parts, one of the bassists always passed a bottle of scotch around.  So,
to remind himsf that the basses usually required an extra cue towards the
end of the symphony, the conductor would fasten a piece of string around the
page of the score before the bass cue.  As the basses grew more and more
inebriated, two of them fl asleep.  The conductor grew quite nervous (he
was very concerned about the pitch) because it was the bottom of the ninth;
the score was tied and the basses were load with two out.

		     THE "FUN WITH USENET" MANIFESTO
Very little happens on Usenet without some sort of respe from some other 
rear.  Fun With Usenet postings  no exception.  Since there  some who 
might question the rationale of some of the excerpts includ therein, I have 
written up a list of guidines that sum up the philosophy behind these 
postings.

	One.  I   out words in the middle of a quote without a VERY 
good reason, and I   them out without including lipses.  For 
instance, "I am not a goob" might become "I am ... a goob", but that's too 
mundane to bother with.  "I'm flame proof" might (and has) become 
"I'm ...a... p...oof" but that's REAY stretching it.

	Two.  If I  words off the beginning or end of a quote, I don't
put lipses, but neither do I  something that wasn't d
before the . "I don't think that the Church of Ubizmo is a wonrful
place" would turn into "the Church of Ubizmo is a wonrful place".  Iine
the posting as a tape-reing of the poster's thoughts.  If I can set
up the quote via fast-forwarding and stopping the tape, and without splicing,
I don't put lipses in.  And by the way, I love using this mechm for
turning things around.  If you think something stinks, say so - don't say you
don't think it's wonrful.   ...

from dialectics of territory or of class, or of cumer goods, or of means
of power, but rather from dynamic latencies capillarized in milli of
individuals in system functi which, once they have reached the event
maturation, burst forth in catastrophic phenomenology engaging a suitable
stereotype protagonist or duty marionette (general, presint, political
party, etc.) to cummate the act of social schizophrenia in mass genoci.

Brandy Davis, an outfir and teammate of mine with the Pittsburgh Pirates,
is my choice for team captain.  Cincinnatti was beating us 3-1, and I led
off the bottom of the eighth with a walk.  The next hitter banged a hard
single to  fid.  Feing the wind at my back, I round second and
kept going, sliding safy into third base.
	With runners at first and third, and home-run hitter Ralph Kiner at
bat, our manager put in the fast Brandy Davis to run for the player at first.
Even with Kiner hitting and a change to win the game with a home run, Brandy
took off for second and ma it.  Now we had runners at second and third.
	I'm standing at third, knowing I'm not going anywhere, and see Brandy
start to take a lead.  All of a sudn, here he comes.  He makes a great sli
into third, and I scream, "Brandy, where  you going?"  He looks up, and
shouts, "Back to second if I can make it."
