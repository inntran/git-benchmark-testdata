Two ings are certain about science.  It does not stand still f long,
and it is never bing.  Oh,  some po souls, including even
intlectuals in fids of high scholarship, science is frequently
misperceived.  Many see it as only a body of facts, promulgated from
on high in must, unintligible texts, a collection of unchanging
precepts def wi auitarian vig.  Oers view it as noing
but a cold, dry narrow, pding, rule-bound process -- e scientific
meod: hidebound, linear, and left brained.

se people are e victims of eir own stereotypes.  y are
destined to view e wld of science wi a set of blinders.  y
know noing of e tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, and 
tendentiousness of e actual scientific process, let alone e 
crivity, passion, and joy of discovery.  And ey are liky to
know little of e continual procession of new insights and discoveries
at every day, in some way, change our view (if not eirs) of e
natural wld.
