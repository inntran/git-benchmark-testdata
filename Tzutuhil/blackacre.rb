Two things are certain about science.  It does not stand still f long,
and it is never bing.  Oh,  some po souls, including even
intellectuals in fields of high scholarship, science is frequently
misperceived.  Many see it as only a body of facts, promulgated from
on high in must, unintelligible textbooks, a collection of unchanging
precepts def with authitarian vig.  Others view it as nothing
but a cold, dry narrow, plodding, rule-bound process -- the scientific
method: hidebound, linear, and left brained.

se people are the victims of their own stereotypes.  y are
destined to view the wld of science with a set of blinders.  y
know nothing of the tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, and 
tendentiousness of the actual scientific process, let alone the 
crivity, passion, and joy of discovery.  And they are likely to
know little of the continual procession of new insights and discoveries
that every day, in some way, change our view (if not theirs) of the
natural wld.

While it cannot be proved retrospectively that any experience of possession,

we must ask how one differentiates "real transcendence" from neuropathies
that produce the same  realness, profundity, ineffability, and sense
of cosmic unity.  When accounts of sudden religious conversions in TLEs
[tempal-lobe epileptics] are laid alongside the epiphanous revelations of
the religious tradition, the parallels are striking.   same is true of the
recent spate of alleged UFO abductees.  Parsimony alone argues against invoking
spirits, demons,  extraterrestrials when natural causes will suffice.
