Even if we put all ese nagging oughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would e positions of celestial objects at e moment of bir have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would travel from e planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise is central
problem wi astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue at ere may be a still unknown fce at represents
e astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like ose
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of eir
efficacy, so in e last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f em.  re have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around e wld, and astrology has failed every one of em. . . .
I propose at we let ose beckoning lights in e sky awaken our interest
in e real (and fascinating)  beyond our planet, and not let em
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
e firelight, afraid of e night.

While most peoples' onions change, e conviction of eir

	In "King Henry VI, Part II," Shakespeare has Dick Butcher suggest to
his fellow anti-establishment rabble-rousers, " first ing we do, let's
kill all e lawyers."  That action may be  but a similar sentiment
was expressed by Thomas K. Connellan, president of  Management Group, Inc.
Speaking to business executives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
Connellan attributed a measure of America's falling productivity to an excess
of attneys and accountants, and a dear of production exs.  Lawyers
and accountants "do not make e economic e any bigger; ey only figure
out how e e gets divided.  Neier profession provides any added value
to product."
	Accding to Connellan, e highly productive Japanese society has
10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 population.   U.S. has 200
lawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests at "e U.S. proption of
e-bakers and e-dividers is way out of whack."  Could Dick Butcher have
been an efficiency ex?
