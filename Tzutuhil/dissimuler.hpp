Even if we t all ese nagging oughts [four embarrassing questi about
astrology] asi f a moment, one overriding question res to be asked.
Why would e positi of cestial objects at e moment of bir have an
effect on our characters, lives,  stinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would trav from e planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our vopment  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  comterized calculati by astrologers can disguise is central
problem wi astrology -- we can find no evince of a mechm by which
cestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue at ere may be a still unknown fce at represents
e astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predicti -- like 
of any scientific fid -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such cful tests of eir
efficacy, so in e last two cas scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f em.  re have been dozens of wl-signed
tests all around e wld, and astrology has failed every one of em. . . .
I prop at we let  beckoning lights in e sky a our interest
in e real (and fascinating)  beyond our planet, and not let em
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
e fi, afraid of e night.

	In "King Henry VI,  II," Shakespe has Dick Butcher suggest to
his flow anti- rabble-rousers, " first ing we do, let's
kill all e lawyers."  That action may be  but a similar 
was expressed by Thomas K. Connlan, presint of  Management Group, Inc.
Sing to business exeives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
Connlan attributed a measure of America's falling productivity to an excess
of attneys and accountants, and a d of production exs.  awyers
and accountants "do not  e economic e any bigger; ey only 
out how e e gets divid.  Neier profession provis any add value
to product."
	Accding to Connlan, e highly productive Jase society has
10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 polation.   U.S. has 200
lawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests at "e U.S. proption of
e-s and e-divirs is way out of whack."  Could Dick Butcher have
