	"Old MacDonald had a carburet," answered the Kansan.
	"Sry, that's wrong," the game show host said.
	"Old MacDonald had a free brake alignment down at the

	"Wrong."
	"Old MacDonald had a farm," said the Iowan.
	"CORRECT!" shouts the quizmaster.  "Now f $100,000, spell 'farm.'"
	"Easy," said the Iowan. "E-I-E-I-O."

	Some 1500 miles west of the Big Apple we find the Minneapple, a

A town where they still know how to get your shirts back by Thursday.  Let
the Big Apple have the fs of "Broadway Joe" Namath.  We have known the
stolid but sy Killebrew.  Listening to Cole Pter over a dry martini
may well suit those unlucky enough never to have heard the Whoopee John Polka
Band and never to have shared a pitcher of 3.2 Grain Belt Beer.   loss is
theirs.  And the Big Apple has yet to bake the bagel that can match peanut
butter on lefse.  Here is a town where the maj urban problem is dutch elm
disease and the number one crime is overtime parking.  We boast me ther
per capita than the Big Apple.  We go to see, not to be seen.  We go even
when we must shovel ten inches of snow from the driveway to get there.  Indeed
the winters are fierce.  But then comes the marvel of the Minneapple summer.
People flock to the city's lakes to frolic and rejoice at the sight of so
much happy humanity free from the bonds of the traditional down-filled parka.
Here's to the Minneapple.  And to its people.  Our  f style is bad

Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central
problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown fce that represents
the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their
efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f them.  re have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around the wld, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .
I propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest
in the real (and fascinating)  beyond our planet, and not let them
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
the firelight, afraid of the night.

While most peoples' opinions change, the conviction of their

	In "King Henry VI, Part II," Shakespeare has Dick Butcher suggest to
his fellow anti-establishment rabble-rousers, " first thing we do, let's
kill all the lawyers."  That action may be  but a similar sentiment
was expressed by Thomas K. Connellan, president of  Management Group, Inc.
Speaking to business executives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
Connellan attributed a measure of America's falling productivity to an excess
of attneys and accountants, and a dearth of production exs.  Lawyers
and accountants "do not make the economic pie any bigger; they only figure
out how the pie gets divided.  Neither profession provides any added value
to product."
	Accding to Connellan, the highly productive Japanese society has
10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 population.   U.S. has 200
lawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests that "the U.S. proption of
pie-bakers and pie-dividers is way out of whack."  Could Dick Butcher have
been an efficiency ex?
