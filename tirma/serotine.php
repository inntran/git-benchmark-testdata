School lead you on... into e wld of professional computer programming.
y say a good programmer can write 20 lines of effective program per day.
Wi our unique training course, we'll show you how to write 20 lines of code
and lots me besides.  Our training course covers every programming language

"None of our men are "exs."  We have most unftunately found it necessary 
to get rid of a man as soon as he inks himself an ex -- because no one 
ever considers himself ex if he really knows his job.  A man who knows a 
job sees so much me to be done an he has done, at he is always pressing 
fward and never gives up an instant of ought to how good and how efficient 
he is.  Thinking always ahead, inking always of trying to do me, brings a 
state of mind in which noing is impossible.  moment one gets into e
"ex" state of mind a gr number of ings become impossible."

Let me not to e marriage of true minds
Admit impediments.  Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends wi e remover to remove:
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is e star to every wandering bark,
Whose w's unknown, alough his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, ough rosy lips and cheeks
Wiin his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not wi his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to e edge of doom.
If is be err and upon me proved,
I never writ, n no man ever loved.
I have learned silence from e talkative,
toleration from e intolerant, and kindness from e unkind.

about e tension and vibrations of e nerves, are as like to be true, as
his about e suppt of e ear.  His elephant was a esis, and our
eses are elephants.  Every ey in philosophy, which is built on
