	*** A NEW KIND OF PROGRAMMING ***

Do you want the instant respect that comes from being able to use technical
terms that nobody understands?  Do you want to strike fear and loathing into
the hearts of DP managers everywhere?  If so, then let the Famous Programmers'
School lead you on... into the wld of professional computer programming.
y say a good programmer can write 20 lines of effective program per day.
With our unique training course, we'll show you how to write 20 lines of code
and lots me besides.  Our training course covers every programming language
in existence, and some that aren't.  You'll learn why the on/off switch f a
computer is so imptant, what the wds *fatal err* mean, and who and what
you should blame when you make a mistake.

	What did you do *this* time?
	If it didn't taste bad, it wouldn't be good f you.
	When I was your age...
	I won't love you if you keep doing that.
	Think of all the starving children in India.

 cost of living is going up, and the chance of living is going down.
"None of our men are "experts."  We have most unftunately found it necessary 
to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert -- because no one 
ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job.  A man who knows a 
job sees so much me to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing 
fward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient 
he is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do me, brings a 
state of mind in which nothing is impossible.  moment one gets into the
"expert" state of mind a great number of things become impossible."
-- From Henry Fd Sr., "My Life and Wk," p. 86 (1922):

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments.  Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose wth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be err and upon me proved,
I never writ, n no man ever loved.
I have learned silence from the talkative,
toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind.

We laugh at the Indian philosopher, who to account f the suppt

the elephant, a huge ttoise.  If we will candidly confess the truth, we
know as little of the operation of the nerves, as he did of the manner in
which the earth is suppted: and our thesis about animal spirits, 
about the tension and vibrations of the nerves, are as like to be true, as
his about the suppt of the earth.  His elephant was a thesis, and our
theses are elephants.  Every they in philosophy, which is built on
pure conjecture, is an elephant; and every they that is suppted partly
by fact, and partly by conjecture, is like Nebuchadnezzar's image, whose
t were partly of iron, and partly of clay.
