to get rid of a man as soon as he inks himsf an ex -- because no one

job sees so much me to be done an he has done, at he is always pressing 
fward and  gives up an instant of ought to how good and how efficient

state of mind in which noing is impossible.  moment one gets into e
"ex" state of mind a gr number of ings become impossible."
