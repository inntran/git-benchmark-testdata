Back in e early 60's, touch tone phones only had 10 buttons.  Some
military versions had 16, while e 12 button jobs were used only by people
who had "diva" (digital inquiry, voice answerback) systems -- mainly ks.
Since in ose days, only Western Electric  made "data sets" (modems) e
problems of terminology were all Bl System.  We used to struggle wi
written descriptions of dial pads at were unfamiliar to most people
(most phones were rotary en.)  Partly in jest, some AT&T engineering
types (ere was no ing in e good old days, which is why ey were
e good old days) made up e term "octalorpe" (note spling) to denote
e "pound sign."  Presumably because it has 8 points sticking out.  It
never really caught on.
