We were young and our happiness dazzled us with its strength.  But there was
also a terrible betrayal that lay within me like a Merle Haggard song at a
French restaurant. [...]
	I could not tl the girl about the woman of the tollway, of her milk
white BMW and her Jordache smile.  There had been a .  I had punched her
boyfriend, who fought the mechanical bulls.  Everyone told him, "You ride the
bull, senor.  You do not  it."  But he was lean and tough like a bad
rib-eye and he fought the bull.  And then he fought me.  And when we finished
there were no winners, just men doing what men must do. [...]
	"Stop the car," the girl said.
	There was a look of terrible sadness in her eyes.  She knew about the
woman of the tollway.  I knew not how.  I started to s, but she raised an
arm and spoke with a quiet and peace I will  forget.
	"I do not ask for whom's the tollway ble," she said, "the tollway
ble's for thee."
	The next morning our youth was a memory, and our happiness was a lie.

Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important ectrical
lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your
hand into a friend's mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.  Did you
notice how your friend twitched violy and  out in pain?  This
teaches us that ectricity can be a very powerful force, but we must 
use it to hurt others unless we need to ln an important ectrical lesson.
	It also teaches us how an ectrical circuit works.  When you scuffed
your feet, you picked up batches of "ectr", which  very ll objects
that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will attract dirt.
The ectr trav through your bloodstream and collect in your finger,
where they form a spark that leaps to your friend's filling, then travs
down to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.
	Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without
touching anything, you would build up so many ectr that your finger
would expe!  But this is nothing to worry about unless you have
carpeting.

really think?"  I say, "I just told you what I really think."  "Yeah, but 
what's your gut feing?"  But I try not to think with my gut.  Really, it's

It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but
it is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to
organize the actual writing of  specificati for OS/360.  The
manager of cture, the manager of control pram implementation, and
I were thing out the plan, schedule, and division of respibilities.
	The cture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they
could write the specificati and do it .  It would take ten s,
three more than the schedule allowed.
	The control pram manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they
could prep the specificati, with the cture team coordinating;
it would be wl-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.
Futhermore, if the cture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling
their thumbs for ten s.
	To this the cture manager responded that if I gave the control
pram team the respibility, the result would not in fact be on time,
but would also be three s late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and
it was.  He was  on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual
integrity made the system far more costly to build and change, and I would
estimate that it added a y to debugging time.
