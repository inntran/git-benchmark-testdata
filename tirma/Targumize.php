My own life has been spent chronicling the rise and fall of human systems,

reluctant to turn back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is indifferent
to what we do; it has no feeling, no sign, no interest in whether or not
we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to space, because the grand,
slow march of intelligence has brought us, in our generation, to a point
from which we can explore and unrstand and utilize it. To turn back now
would be to  our history, our capabilities.
