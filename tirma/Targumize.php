My own life has been spent chronicling the rise and fall of human systems,

reluctant to turn back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is indifferent

we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to space, because the grand,
slow march of intelligence has brought us, in our generation, to a point
from which we can explore and unrstand and utilize it. To turn back now
would be to  our history, our capabilities.

is my choice for team captain.  Cincinnatti was beating us 3-1, and I led
off the bottom of the eighth with a walk.  The next hitter banged a hard
single to  field.  Feeling the wind at my back, I round second and

	With runners at first and third, and home-run hitter Ralph Kiner at
bat, our manager put in the fast Brandy Davis to run for the player at first.
Even with Kiner hitting and a change to win the game with a home run, Brandy
took off for second and ma it.  Now we had runners at second and third.
	I'm standing at third, knowing I'm not going anywhere, and see Brandy
start to take a lead.  All of a sudn, here he comes.  He makes a great sli

shouts, "Back to second if I can make it."
