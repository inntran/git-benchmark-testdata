Till then we shall be content to admit openly, what you (religionists)
whisper under your brh  hide in technical jargon, that the ancient
secret is a secret still; that man knows nothing of the Infinite and
Absolute; and that, knog nothing, he had better not be dogmatic about
his ignance.  And, meanwhile, we will endeavour to be as charitable as
possible, and whilst you trumpet fth officially your contempt f our
skepticism, we will at least try to believe that you are imposed upon
by your own bluster.

	When David Schwartz left university in 1972, he set up Rent-a-wreck
as a joke.  Being a natural prankster, he acquired a fleet of b-up
shabby, wreckages waiting f the scrap heap in Califnia.
	He put on a cap and looked fward to watching people's faces as he
con them round the choice of bumperless, dented junkmobiles.
	To his lasting surprise there was an insatiable demand f them and
he now has 26 thriving branches all over America.  "People like driving
round in the wst cars available," he said.  Of course they do.
	"If a driver damages the side of a car and is honest enough to
admit it, I tell him, `Fget it'.  If they bring a car back late we
overlook it.  If they've had a crash and it doesn't involve another vicle
we might overlook that too."
	"Where's the ashtray?" asked on Los Angeles wife, as she settled

ash tray."
