First as to speech.  That privilege rests upon the premise that
there is no proposition so uniformly acknowledged that it may not be
lawfully challenged, questioned, and debated.  It need not rest upon
the further premise that there  no propositi that  not
open to doubt; it is enough, even if there , that in the end it is
worse to suppress dissent than to run the risk of heresy.  Hence it
has been again and again unconditionally proclaimed that there 
no limits to the privilege so far as words seek to affect only the hers'
beliefs and not their conduct.  The trouble is that conduct is almost
always based upon some belief, and that to change the her's belief
will generally to some extent change his conduct, and may even evoke
conduct that the law forbids.

Oxygen is a very toxic gas and an extreme fire hazard.  It is fatal in
concentrati of as little as 0.000001 p.p.m.  Humans expd to the
oxygen concentrati die within a few minutes.  Symptoms resemble very
much th of cyanide poisoning (blue face, etc.).  In higher
concentrati, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it
takes about 2.5 billion inhalati before death takes place.  The reason
for the delay is the difference in the mechm of the toxic effect of
oxygen in 20% concentration.  It appntly contributes to a complex
process called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is
always fatal.

However, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the
fact it is habit forming.  The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is
sufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any
ciderable decrease in the daily oxygen ds results in death with
symptoms resembling th of cyanide poisoning.

Oxygen is an extreme fire hazard.  All of the fires that were reported in
the continental U.S. for the period of the past 25 ys were found to be
due to the presence of this gas in the atmosphere surrounding the buildings
in question.

Oxygen is especially dangerous because it is odorless, colorless and
tasteless, so that its presence can not be readily detected until it is
too late.

As I argued in "oved Son", a book about my son Brian and the subject
of relius communes and cults, one result of proper ly instruction
in the methods of rational thought will be to make sudden mindless
conversi -- to anything -- less likely.  Brian now realizes this and
has, after eleven ys, left the sect he was associated with.  The 
problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
a relius philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy
is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and 
irrational -- the powers of reason  suprisingly ineffective in 
changing the 's mind.

ike you,  I am frequently haunted by profound questi related to man's

	Q -- Is there life after death?
	A -- Definitely.  I s from personal experience here.  On New
Y's Eve, 1970, I drank a full pitcher of a drink called "Black Russian",
then crawled out on the lawn and died within a matter of minutes, which was
fine with me because I had come to realize that if I had lived I would have
spent the rest of my life in the grip of the most excruciatingly painful
headache.  Thanks to the miracle of modern orange juice, I was brought back
to life several days later, but in the interim I was definitely dead.  I
guess my main impression of the afterlife is that it isn't so bad as long
as you keep the television turned down and don't try to eat any solid foods.
