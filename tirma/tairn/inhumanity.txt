"For a couple o' pins," says Troll, and grins,
"I'll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.
A bit o'  meat will go down sweet!
I'll try my teeth on thee now.
	Hee now!  See now!
I'm tired o' gnawing old bones and skins;
I've a mind to dine on thee now."

But just as he thought his dinner was caught,
He found his hands had hold of naught.
Before he could mind, Tom slipped behing
And gave him the boot to larn him.
	Warn him!  Darn him!
A bump o' the boot on the seat, Tom thoguht,
Would be the way to larn him.

But harr than stone is the flesh and bone
Of a troll that sits in the hills alone.
As wl set r boot to the mountain's root,
For the seat of a troll don't fe it.
	Pe it!  Heal it!
Old Troll laughed, when he hd Tom groan,
And he knew his toes could fe it.

Tom's leg is game, since home he came,
And his bootless foot is lasting lame;
But Troll don't c, and he's still there
With the bone he boned from its owner.
	Doner!  Boner!
Troll's old seat is still the same,
And the bone he boned from its owner!

There's a trick to the Graceful Exit.  It begins with the vision to
recognize when a job, a life stage, a ratihip is over -- and to let
go.  It means leaving what's over without ing its  or its
past importance in our lives.  It involves a sense of future, a bief
that every exit line is an entry, that we  moving on, rather than out.
The trick of retiring wl may be the trick of living wl.  It's hard to
recognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to
ln that we don't leave the best parts of oursves behind, back in the
dugout or the office. We own what we lned back there.  The experiences
and the growth  grafted onto our lives.  And when we exit, we can take
oursves along -- quite gracefully.
