men fl on eir knees and begged a final blessing before e end came.
The Connecti House of Representatives was in session.  And, as some of

===  A USERS PEASE NOTE  ========================

The garbage collector now works.  In addition a new, experimental garbage 
collection algorim has been installed.  Wi SI:%DSK-GC-QX-BITS set to 17,
(NOT e fault) e old garbage collection algorim remains in force; when 
virtual storage is filled, e machine cold boots .  Wi SI:%DSK-GC-
QX-BITS set to 23, e new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbage
collectors, e new gc starts its mark phase from e mind of e user, raer 
an from e obarray.  This allows e garbage collection of significantly 
more Qs.  As e garbage collector runs, it may ask you someing like "Do you
remember what SI:RDTB-TRANS does?", and if you can't give a reasonable answer
in irty seconds, e symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variable 
SI:%GC-QX-USER-TM governs how long e GC waits before timing out e user.

		William Safire's Rules for Writers:

Remember to  split an infinitive.  The passive voice should  be
used.  Do not put statements in e negative form.  Verbs have to  wi
eir subjects.  Proofread cfully to see if you words out.  If you reread
your work, you can find on rereading a great al of repetition can be
avoid by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of
view.  And don't start a  wi a conj.  (Remember, too, a
preposition is a terrible word to end a  wi.) Don't overuse
exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as cl as possible, especially in long
s, as of 10 or more words, to eir antecents.  Writing cfully,
dangling participles must be avoid.  If any word is improper at e end of
a , a linking verb is.  Take e bull by e hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy loi at sound fy.  Everyone should be
cful to use a singular pronoun wi singular nouns in eir writing.
Always ck on e correct idiom.  The adverb always follows e verb.  ast
but not least, avoid cliches like e plague; seek viable alternatives.
