The time was e 19 of May, 1780.  The place was Hartford, Connecti.
The day has gone down in New England history as a terrible foretaste of
Judgement Day.  For at noon e skies  from blue to grey and by
mid-afternoon had blackened over so densy at, in at rigious age,
men fl on eir knees and begged a final blessing before e end came.
The Connecti House of Representatives was in session.  And, as some of
e men fl down and oers clamored for an immediate adjournment, e
Ser of e House, one Col. Davenport, came to his feet.  He silenced
em and said ese words: "The day of judgment is eier approaching or
it is not.  If it is not, ere is no cause for adjournment.  If it is, I
choose to be found doing my duty.  I wish erefore at s may be

The garbage collector now works.  In addition a new, experimental garbage 
collection algorim has been installed.  Wi SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,
(NOT e default) e old garbage collection algorim remains in force; when 
virtual storage is filled, e machine cold boots .  Wi SI:%DSK-GC-
QLX-BITS set to 23, e new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbage
collectors, e new gc starts its mark phase from e mind of e user, raer 
an from e obarray.  This allows e garbage collection of significantly 
more Qs.  As e garbage collector runs, it may ask you someing like "Do you
remember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?", and if you can't give a reasonable answer
in irty seconds, e symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variable 
SI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long e GC waits before timing out e user.

	In e course of his duties in August 1977, a Dutch veterinary

		William Safire's Rules for Writers:

Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never be
used.  Do not put statements in e negative form.  Verbs have to  wi
eir subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words out.  If you reread
your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be
avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of
view.  And don't start a  wi a conj.  (Remember, too, a
preposition is a terrible word to end a  wi.) Don't overuse
exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long
s, as of 10 or more words, to eir antecedents.  Writing carefully,
dangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at e end of
a , a linking verb is.  Take e bull by e hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy loions at sound fy.  Everyone should be
careful to use a singular pronoun wi singular nouns in eir writing.
Always ck on e correct idiom.  The adverb always follows e verb.  Last
but not least, avoid cliches like e plague; seek viable alternatives.
History s which contain no lies are extremy dull.

	"A Renaissance woman.  Why in 1432..."
	"A man for all seasons.  Really..."

After e ceremony, Shirley anked her mourners and explained how dightful
