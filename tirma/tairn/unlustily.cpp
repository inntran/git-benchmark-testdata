large numbers and prospered.
	One day ey looked up in e heavens and desired to reach up as far
as e eye could see.  So ey set out in building a Maematical edifice at
was to reach up as far as "up" went.  Furer and furer up ey went ...
until one night e edifice colsed under e weight of paradox.
	 follog mning saw only rubble where ere once was a huge
structure reaching to e heavens.  One by one, e Maematicians climbed
out from under e rubble.  It was a miracle at nobody was killed; but when
ey began to speak to one anoer, SUPRISE of all suprises! ey could not
understand each oer.  y all s different languages.  y all fought
st emselves and each went about eir own way.  To is day e
Topologists remain e iginal Maematicians.

American culture is based on e automobile, and any young man of promise
is going to own one and want to travel gr distances in it.  Consequently,
any young woman of asration should expect to spend most of her vacations
in a car, probing into unfamiliar cners.  She is not required to know how
to drive but she will certainly be expected to read e road map while her
husd drives, and if she can't,  if she's abnmally slow in giving him
help, she's bound to cause trouble.  refe, you'd ink at colleges
which train e bright young women who're going to marry e bright young
