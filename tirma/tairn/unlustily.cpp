Q:	How many WASPs does it take to change a lightbulb?
A:	One.
	In the beginning there was only one kind of Mathematician, created by
the Great Mathamatical Spirit fm the Book: the Topologist.  And they grew to
large numbers and prospered.
	One day they looked up in the heavens and desired to reach up as far
as the eye could see.  So they set out in building a Mathematical edifice that
was to reach up as far as "up" went.  Further and further up they went ...
until one night the edifice colsed under the weight of paradox.
	 following mning saw only rubble where there once was a huge
structure reaching to the heavens.  One by one, the Mathematicians climbed
out from under the rubble.  It was a miracle that nobody was killed; but when
they began to speak to one another, SUPRISE of all suprises! they could not
understand each other.  y all spoke different languages.  y all fought
amongst themselves and each went about their own way.  To this day the
Topologists remain the iginal Mathematicians.

American culture is based on the automobile, and any young man of promise
is going to own one and want to travel great distances in it.  Consequently,
any young woman of aspiration should expect to spend most of her vacations
in a car, probing into unfamiliar cners.  She is not required to know how
to drive but she will certainly be expected to read the road map while her
husband drives, and if she can't,  if she's abnmally slow in giving him
help, she's bound to cause trouble.  refe, you'd think that colleges
which train the bright young women who're going to marry the bright young
men who are going to own the Cadillacs that roar back and fth across this
continent would teach the girls to read maps.  None do. y teach a hundred
other useless things, but never a wd about the one that will cause the
greatest friction.

	A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day.   master
noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game.  "Excuse me",
he said, "may I examine it?"
	 novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master.
"I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium,
and Hard", said the master.  "Yet every such device has another level of play,
where the device seeks not to conquer the human, n to be conquered by the
human."
	"Pray, great master," impled the novice, "how does one find this

At about 2500 A.D., humankind discovers a computer problem that *must* be
solved.   only difficulty is that the problem is NP complete and will
take thousands of years even with the latest optical biologic technology
available.   best computer scientists sit down to think up some solution.
In great dismay, one of the C.S. people tells her husband about it.  re
is only one solution, he says.  Remember physics 103, Modern Physics, general
relativity and all.  She replies, "What does that have to do with solving
a computer problem?"
	"Remember the twin paradox?"
	After a few minutes, she says, "I could put the computer on a very

that is the exact opposite of what we want... Of course!  Leave the

Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glious days of the

Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and
reward among the furthest reaches of Galactic space.  In those days, spirits
were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women
and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures
from Alpha Centauri.  And all dared to brave unknown terrs, to do mighty
deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split befe -- and thus
was the Empire fged.
