Gentlemen,
	Whilst marching from Portugal to a position which commands the
approach to Madrid and the French forces, my officers have been
diligently complying with your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship
from London to Lisbon and thence by dispatch to our headquarters.
	We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles,
and all  of sundry items for which His Majesty's Government holds
me accountable. I have dispatched reports on the character, wit, and
spleen of every officer. Each item and every farthing has been accounted
for, with two regrettable exceptions for which I beg your indulgence.
	Unfortunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence res
unaccounted for in one infantry battalion's petty cash and there has been
a hious confusion as the the number of jars of raspberry jam issued to
one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm in western Spain.  This
reprehensible clessness may be related to the pressure of circumstance,
since we  war with France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise
to you gentlemen in Whitehall.
	This brings me to my present rp, which is to request
elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty's Government so that I
may better unrstand why I am dragging an army over these  plains.
I con that perforce it must be one of two alternative duties, as
given below.  I shall rsue either one with the best of my ability, but
I cannot do both:
	1. To train an army of uniformed British clerks in Spain for the
benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London or perchance:
	2. To see to it that the forces of Napoleon  driven out of Spain.

... But if we laugh with rision, we will  unrstand.  Human
intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as

that now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our unrstanding
of their world, not in their distorted perceptions.  Even the standard
example of ancient nonsense -- the bate about angels on pinheads --

whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a
finite or an infinite number.

If science were explained to the average person in a way that is accessible
and exciting, there would be no room for pseudoscience.  But there is a kind
of Gresham's Law by which in polar culture the bad science drives out the
good.  And for this I think we have to blame, first, the scientific community
ourselves for not doing a better job of polarizing science, and second, the
media, which  in this respect almost uniformly dreadful.  Every newspaper
in America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weekly
astronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educational
system.  We do not teach how to think.  This is a very serious failure that
may even, in a world rigged with 60,000 nuclear weapons, compromise the human
future.
