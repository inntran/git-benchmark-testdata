	"Please excuse me, sir, I'm blind and I bumped into  accintally,"
apologized the rabbit.
	"That's quite all right," rep the snake, "I have the same
problem!"
	"All my life I've been wonring what I am," said the rabbit, "Do
 think  could help me find out?"

and long ears.  You're... hmmm... 're probably a bunny rabbit!"

suppose  could try and tell me?"
	The rabbit ran his paws all over the snake.  "Well, 're low, cold
and slimey..."  And, as he ran one paw unrneath the snake, "and  have
no balls.  You must be an attorney!"
