 Modelski Chain Rule:
(1)	Look intently at the problem f several minutes.  Scratch your
	head at 20-30 second intervals.  Try solving the problem on your
	Hewlett-Packard.
(2)	Failing this, look around at the class.  Select a particularly
	bright-looking individual.
(3)	Procure a large chain.
(4)	Walk over to the selected student and thren to b him severely
	with the chain unless he gives you the answer to the problem.
	Generally, he will.  It may also be a good idea to give him a sound
	thrashing anyway, just to show you mean business.

Jane and I got mixed up with a television show --  as we call it back
east here: TV -- a clever contraction derived from the wds Terrible
Vaudeville. However, it is our latest medium -- we call it a medium
because nothing's well done. It was discovered, I suppose you've heard,
by a man d Fulton Berle, and it has already revolutionized social
grace by cutting down parlour conversation to two sentences: "What's on
television?" and "Good night".

Keep in mind always the four constant Laws of Frisbee:
	(1)  most powerful fce in the wld is that of a disc
	   straining to land under a car, just out of reach (this
	   fce is technically termed "car suck").
	(2) Never precede any maneuver by a comment me predictive
	   than "Watch this!"
	(3)  probability of a Frisbee hitting something is directly
	   proptional to the cost of hitting it.  F instance, a
	   Frisbee will always head directly towards a policeman 
	   a little old lady rather than the b up Chevy.
	(4) Your best throw happens when no one is watching; when the
	   cute girl you've been trying to impress is watching, the
	   Frisbee will invariably bounce out of your hand  hit you
	   in the head and knock you silly.
