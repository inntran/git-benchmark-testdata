curtation, n.:
	The enforced compression of a string in the fixed-length field
environment.
	The problem of fitting extremely variable-length strings such as names,
addresses, and item scriptions into fixed-length records is no trivial
matter.  Neglect of the subtle art of curtation has probably alienated more
people than any other aspect of data processing.  You orr Mozart's "Don
Giovanni" from your record club, and they invoice you $24.95 for MOZ DONG.
The witless mapping of the sublime onto the ridiculous!  Equally puzzling is
the curtation that produces the same eight characters, THE BEST, whether you
orr "The Best of Wagner", "The Best of Schubert", or "The Best of the Turds".
Similarly, wine lovers buying from computerized wineries twirl their glasses,
check their livery notes, and inform their friends, "A rather innocent,

cited are real, and the curtational methodology which produced them is still
with us.

The duck hunter trained his retriever to walk on water.  Eager to show off 
this amazing accomplishment, he asked a friend to go along on his next
hunting trip.  Saying nothing, he fired his first shot and, as the duck fell,
the dog walked on the surface of the water, retrieved the duck and returned
it to his master.
	"Notice anything?" the owner asked eagerly.
	"Yes," said his friend, "I see that fool dog of yours can't swim."

... But if we laugh with rision, we will never unrstand.  Human
intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as
we can tell.  If intelligent people invested intense energy in issues
that now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our unrstanding
of their world, not in their distorted perceptions.  Even the standard
example of ancient nonsense -- the bate about angels on pinheads --
makes sense once you realize that theologians were not discussing
whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a

New York is a jungle, they tell you.  You could go further, and say that

Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and related
hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences, entails
dangers that must not be unrestimated.  Practitioners must take into
account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability to
influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The history
of LSD to date amply monstrates the catastrophic consequences that can
ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken
for a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance preperations
are required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful
experience.

***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)

It has been wily recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge 
in orr to perform well in complex dos.  But knowledge alone is not
sufficient for some applications; wisdom is need as well.  Accordingly, 
we have veloped a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call 
"wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ias, we have written IMMANUEL, a 
wisdom based system for the task do of western philosophical thought.  
IMMANUEL was supp initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom 
about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so 
forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guid by the heuristic 
rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL 
succeed in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ias veloped 
in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those 
unrlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory
of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will scribe 
IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly 
discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

Wanna tell you all a story 'bout a man named Jed,
A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed.
But then one day he was shootin' at some food,
When up through the ground come a bubblin' cru -- oil, that is;

Well the next thing ya know, old Jed's a millionaire.
The kinfolk said, 'Jed, move  from there!'
They said, 'Californy is the place ya oughta be',
So they load up the truck and they moved to Beverly -- Hills, that is;
