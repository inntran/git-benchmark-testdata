exchange between our hero and Rep. John D. Dingell, also of Michigan.

DINGE: There  places in the world at the present time where we

HOFFMAN: You mean the oysters I buy  not nature's oysters?
DINGE: They may or may not be natural.  The simple fact of the matter
	 is that female oysters through their living habits cast out
	 large amounts of seed and the male oysters cast out large
	 amounts of fertilization ...

Bistromathics is simply a revolutionary new way of unrstanding the

time was not an absolute, but pend on the observer's movement in
time, so it is now realized that numbers  not absolute, but pend

	There was a mad scientist (a mad... social... scientist) who kidnapped
three colleagues, an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician, and locked 
each of them in seperate cells with plenty of canned food and water but no
can opener.
	A month later, returning, the mad scientist went to the engineer's
cell and found it long empty.  The engineer had ctructed a can opener from
pocket trash, used aluminum shavings and dried sugar to  an explosive,
and escaped.
	The physicist had worked out the angle necessary to knock the lids
off the tin cans by throwing them against the wall.  She was veloping a good
pitching arm and a new quantum theory.
	The mathematician had stacked the unopened cans into a surprising
solution to the kissing problem; his ssicated corpse was propped calmly
against a wall, and this was inscribed on the floor:
	Theorem: If I can't open these cans, I'll die.
	Proof: assume the opposite...

It is an important and polar fact that things  not always what
they seem.  For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed
that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so
much -- the wheel, New York, wars and so on -- whilst all the dolphins
had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.  But
conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more
intelligent than man -- for precisely the same reas.

Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending
struction of the of the planet Earth and had ma many attempts to
alert mankind to the danger; but most of their communicati were
misinterpreted ...

Keep in mind always the four ctant aws of Frisbee:
	(1) The most powerful force in the world is that of a disc
	   straining to land unr a car, just out of reach (this
	   force is technically termed "car suck").
	(2) Never prece any maneuver by a comment more predictive
	   than "Watch this!"
	(3) The probability of a Frisbee hitting something is directly
	   proportional to the cost of hitting it.  For instance, a
	   Frisbee will always head directly towards a policeman or
	   a little old lady rather than the beat up Chevy.
	(4) Your best throw happens when no one is watching; when the
	   cute girl 've been trying to impress is watching, the
	   Frisbee will invariably bounce out of r hand or hit 
	   in the head and knock  silly.

People (a group that in my opinion has always attracted an undue amount of
attention) have often been likened to snowflakes.  This analogy is meant to
suggest that each is unique -- no two alike.  This is quite patently not the
case.  People ...  simply a dime a dozen.  And, I hasten to add, their
only similarity to snowflakes resis in their invariable and lamentable
tenncy to turn, after a few warm days, to slush.
