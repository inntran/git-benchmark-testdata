	In "King Henry VI, Part II," Shakespeare has Dick Butcher suggest to
his fellow anti-establishment rabble-rousers, " first thing we do, let's
kill all the lawyers."  That action may be  but a similar sentiment
was expressed by Thomas K. Connellan, president of  Management Group, Inc.
Speaking to business executives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
Connellan attributed a measure of America's falling productivity to an excess
of attneys and accountants, and a dearth of production exs.  Lawyers
and accountants "do not make the economic pie any bigger; they only figure
out how the pie gets divided.  Neither profession provides any added value
to product."
	Accding to Connellan, the highly productive Japanese society has
10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 population.   U.S. has 200
lawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests that "the U.S. proption of
pie-bakers and pie-dividers is way out of whack."  Could Dick Butcher have
been an efficiency ex?

As stated above, the host area of a disk is structured as a vect of

appropriate to view the host area as a four dimensional hyper-cube, the
four dimensions being cylinder, group, track, and sect.

Referring to our hyper-cube analogy, the set of potentially accessible
blocks fm a line parallel to the track axis.  This line moves
parallel to the sect axis, wrapping around when it reaches the edge
