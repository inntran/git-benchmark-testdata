kill all e lawyers."  That action may be  but a similar 
was expressed by Thomas K. Connlan, presint of  Management Group, Inc.
Sing to business exeives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
Connlan attributed a measure of America's falling productivity to an excess
of attneys and accountants, and a d of production exs.  awyers
and accountants "do not  e economic e any bigger; ey only 
out how e e gets divid.  Neier profession provis any add value

10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 polation.   U.S. has 200
lawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests at "e U.S. proption of
