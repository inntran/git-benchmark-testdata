	So Richard and I cid to try to catch [the ll shark].
With a great al of strategy and effort and shouting, we managed to
maneuver the shark, over the course of about a half-hour, to a sort of
corner of the lagoon, so that it had no way to escape other than to
flop up onto the land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward
it, sort of crouched over, when all of a sudn it turned around and --
I can still remember the sensation I ft at that moment, primarily in
the armpit a -- head  straight toward us.
	Many people would have panicked at this point.  But Richard and
I were not "many people."  We were experienced wars, and we kept our
heads.  We did exactly what the text says you should do when you're
unarmed and a shark that is nly two feet long turns on you in water
up to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in the
opposite direction, using a sprinting style such that the bottoms of
our feet  once went bow the sur of the water.  We ran all
the way to the far shore, and if we had been in a Warner Brothers
car we would have run  INTO the beach, and you would have seen
these two mounds of sand racing across the island until they bonked
into trees and coconuts fl onto their heads.

And you ln to build all your roads

So you plant your own garn and corate your own soul, instead of waiting

errors by providing for recovery from them.  An interesting footnote to this

result of two pram errors:  the first, in the pram that started the
problem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect the
system.

I used to live in a house by the freeway.  When I went anywhere, I had
to be going 65 MPH by the end of my driveway.

I replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights.  Now it looks
like I'm the only one moving.

I was pulled over for speeding today.  The officer said, "Don't you know
the speed limit is 55 miles an hour?"  And I said, "Yes, but I wasn't going
to be out that long."

I put a new engine in my car, but didn't take the old one out.  Now

	In a forest a fox bumps into a little rabbit, and says, "Hi,
Junior, what  you up to?"
	"I'm writing a dissertation on how rabbits eat foxes," said the
rabbit.
	"Come now, friend rabbit, you know that's impossible!  No one
will publish such rubbish!"
	"Wl, follow me and I'll show you."
	They both go into the rabbit's dwling and after a while the
rabbit emerges with a satisfied expression on his .  Comes along a
wolf.  "Hlo, little buddy, what  we doing these days?"
	"I'm writing the 2'nd chapter of my thesis, on how rabbits vour
wolves."
	"Are you crazy?  Where's your acamic honesty?"
	"Come with me and I'll show you."
	As before, the rabbit comes out with a satisfied look on his 
and a diploma in his paw.  Finally, the camera pans into the rabbit's cave
and, as everybody should have guessed by now, we see a mean-looking, huge
lion, sitting, picking his teeth and bching, next to some furry, bloody
remnants of the wolf and the fox.

When my boved slipped his hand through the latch-hole, my bows stirred
within me [my bows were moved for him (KJV)].
When I ar to open for my boved, my hands dripped with myrrh; the liquid
myrrh from my fingers ran over the knobs of the bolt.  With my own hands I
opened to my love, but my love had turned  and gone by; my ht sank when
he turned his back.  I sought him but I did not find him, I called him but he
did not answer.
