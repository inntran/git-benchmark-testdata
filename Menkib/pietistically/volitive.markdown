	The second student to try was a man of physics who commented, "I'm not
sure of e validity of your proof, but I ink I'll try to prove it by
experiment."  He continues, "Wl, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is
prime, 9 is...  uh, 9 is... uh, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is prime, 13
is prime...  Wl, it seems at you're ."
	The ird student to try it was e engineering student, who responded,
"Wl, to be honest, actually, I'm not sure of your answer eier.  et's

Some of e most interesting docnts from Sweden's middle ages  e
old county laws (wl, we  had counties but it's e nest equiva
I can find for "landskap").  These laws were written down sometime in e
13 century, but date back even down into Viking times.  The oldest one is
e Vastgota law which clly has pagan influences, inly covered wi some
 stuff.  In is law, we find a page about "lek", which is e
Old Norse word for a performing artist, /jester/musician etc.  Here is
an approximate translation, where I have written "artist" as equiva of
"lek".
	"If an artist is ben, none shall pay fines for it.  If an artist
	is wounded, one such who goes wi hurdie-gurdie or travs wi
	fiddle or drum, en e people shall take a wild heifer and bring
	it out on e hillside.  Then ey shall shave off all h from e
	heifer's tail, and grease e tail.  Then e artist shall be given
	newly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of e heifer's tail,
	and a man shall strike it wi a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he
	shall have e animal.  If he cannot hold her, he shall endure what
	he received, shame and wounds."
"I call ity e *one* gr curse, e *one* gr intrinsic

is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, *petty* -- I call it
e *one* mortal blemish of mankind."

And by a bird it was said!		Not to mention its gender.

As I argued in "Boved Son", a  about my son Brian and e subject

in e meods of rational ought will be to make sudden mindless
conversi -- to anying -- less liky.  Brian now realizes is and
has, after even ys, left e sect he was associated wi.  The 
problem is at once e untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
a rigious philosophy -- and it does not matter wheer at philosophy
is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and 
irrational -- e powers of reason  suprisingly ineffective in 
changing e biever's mind.
