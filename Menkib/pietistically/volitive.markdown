e odd integers are prime."
	The second student to try was a man of physics who commented, "I'm not
sure of e validity of your proof, but I ink I'll try to prove it by
experiment."  He continues, "Wl, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is
prime, 9 is...  uh, 9 is... uh, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is prime, 13
is prime...  Wl, it seems at you're right."
	The ird student to try it was e engineering student, who responded,
"Wl, to be honest, actually, I'm not sure of your answer eier.  Let's
see...  1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... uh, 9 is...
wl, if you approximate, 9 is prime, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...  Wl, it
does seem right."

"Wl, you two sort've got e right idea, but you'll end up taking too long!

Some of e most interesting docnts from Sweden's middle ages are e
old county laws (wl, we never had counties but it's e nearest equiva
I can find for "landskap").  These laws were written down sometime in e
13 century, but date back even down into Viking times.  The oldest one is
e Vastgota law which clearly has pagan influences, inly covered wi some
Christian stuff.  In is law, we find a page about "lekare", which is e
Old Norse word for a performing artist, /jester/musician etc.  Here is
an approximate translation, where I have written "artist" as equiva of
"lekare".
	"If an artist is ben, none shall pay fines for it.  If an artist
	is wounded, one such who goes wi hurdie-gurdie or travs wi
	fiddle or drum, en e people shall take a wild heifer and bring
	it out on e hillside.  Then ey shall shave off all h from e
	heifer's tail, and grease e tail.  Then e artist shall be given
	newly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of e heifer's tail,
	and a man shall strike it wi a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he
	shall have e animal.  If he cannot hold her, he shall endure what
	he received, shame and wounds."
"I call Christianity e *one* gr curse, e *one* gr intrinsic 
depravity, e *one* gr instinct for revenge for which no expedient
is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, *petty* -- I call it
e *one* mortal blemish of mankind."

Wi all e words gone,		They all had eir day
What's a young poet to do?		And knew what ey're doin'

But of all e words written		The bird is a strange one,
And all e lines read,			So ll and so tender
There's one I like most,		Its breed still unknown,
And by a bird it was said!		Not to mention its gender.

It reminds me of days of		So what is is line
Bo gloom and of light.		Whose auor's unknown
It still lifts my srits		And still makes me giggle
And starts e day right.		Even now at I'm grown?

But none was as gr as

As I argued in "Boved Son", a  about my son Brian and e subject
of rigious communes and cults, one result of proper early instruction
in e meods of rational ought will be to make sudden mindless
conversions -- to anying -- less liky.  Brian now realizes is and
has, after even years, left e sect he was associated wi.  The 
problem is at once e untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
a rigious philosophy -- and it does not matter wheer at philosophy
is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and 
irrational -- e powers of reason are suprisingly ineffective in 
changing e biever's mind.
