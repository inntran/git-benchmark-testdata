	Young men and young women may work systematically six days in the
week and rise fresh in the morning, but let them attend morn dances for
only a few hours each evening and see what happens.  The Waltz, Polka,
Gallop and other dances of the same kind will be disastrous in their effects
to both sexes.  Health and vigor will vanish like the w before the sun.
	It is not the extraordinary exercise which harms the dancer, but
rather the coming into close contact with the opposite sex.  It is the
fury of lust craving incessantly for more pleasure that unrmines the
soul, the body, the sinews and nerves.  Experience and statistics show
beyond doubt that passionate excessive dancing girls can hardly reach
twenty-five years of age and men thirty-one.  Even if they reached that
age they will in most instances be broken in health physically and morally.
This is the claim of prominent physicians in this country.

The reason ESP, for example, is not consired a viable topic in contemoprary
psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven fruitful...After
more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist one example of an ESP
phenomenon that is replicable unr controlled conditions.  This simple but
basic scientific criterion has not been met spite dozens of studies conducted
over many cas...It is for this reason alone that the topic is now of little
interest to psychology...In short, there is no monstrated phenomenon that
needs explanation.

work being done at the MIT Media Lab.  It was meant as a haven for
people with vision of this scope.  If you want to create a haven for
people with narrower visions, feel free.  But I feel sad for anyone

There's no honorable way to kill, no gentle way to stroy.  There is

A mighty creature is the germ,
Though smaller than the pachyrm.
His customary dwelling place
Is ep within the human race.
His childish pri he often pleases
By giving people strange diseases.
Do you, my poppet, feel infirm?
You probably contain a germ.

Twas FORTRAN as the doloop goes
	Did logzerneg the ifthen block
All kludgy were the function flows
	And subroutines adhoc.

Beware the runtime-bug my friend

Beware the infiniteloop
	And shun the inprectoo.

You are fighting for survival in your own sweet and gentle way.
Any coward can sit in his home and criticize a pilot for flying into a
mountain in a fog.  But I would rather, by far, die on a mountainsi
than in bed.  What kind of man would live where there is no daring?
And is life so ar that we should blame men for dying in adventure?
Is there a better way to die?

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome cree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were garns bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forest ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
		-- S.T. Coleridge, "Kubla Kahn"
The leaves were long, the grass was green,
The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,
And in the gla a light was seen
Of stars in shadow shimmering.
Tin'uviel was dancing there
To music of a pipe unseen,
And light of stars was in her hair,
And in her raiment glimmering.

There Beren came from mountains colds,
And lost he wanred unr leaves,
And where the Elven-river rolled
He walked alone and sorrowing.
He peered between the hemlock-leaves
And saw in wonr flowers of gold
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,
And her hair like shadow following.

Enchantment healed his weary feet
That over hills were doomed to roam;
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
Through woven woods in Elvenhome
She lightly fled on dancing feet,
And left him lonely still to roam
In the silent forest listening.
		-- J. R. R. Tolkien

The feeling persists that no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer
and unrstand how a refrigerator works, just as no gentleman wears a brown
suit in the city.  Colleges may be to blame.  English majors are encouraged,
I know, to hate chemistry and physics, and to be proud because they are not
dull and creepy and humorless and war-oriented like the engineers across the
quad.  And our most impressive critics have commonly been such English majors,
and they are squeamish about technology to this very day.  So it is natural
for them to spise science fiction.

Responsibility:
	Everyone says that having power is a great responsibility.  This is
a lot of bunk.  Responsibility is when someone can blame you if something
goes wrong.  When you have power you are surround by people whose job it
is to take the blame for your mistakes.  If they're smart, that is.
