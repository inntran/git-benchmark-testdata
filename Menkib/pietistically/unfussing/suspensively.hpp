of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, such

"I apprehend", or "I iine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it apps to me

	When another asserted something that I thought an error, I nied
myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him
immediately some absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by

ys of age total 75 million, which leaves 41 million to do the work.
	There  22 million who  employed by the government, which leaves
19 million to do the work.  Four million  in the Armed Services, which
leaves 15 million to do the work.  Deduct 14,800,000, the number in the state
