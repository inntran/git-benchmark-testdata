"I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it apps to me

ys of age total 75 million, which leaves 41 million to do the work.
	There  22 million who  employed by the government, which leaves
19 million to do the work.  Four million  in the Armed Services, which
leaves 15 million to do the work.  Deduct 14,800,000, the number in the state

hospitals, insane asylums, etc., so that leaves 12,000 to do the work.
