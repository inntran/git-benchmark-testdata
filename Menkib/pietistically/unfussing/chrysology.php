You first have to decide whether to use the sht  the long fm. 
sht fm is what the Internal Revenue Service calls "simplified", which
means it is designed f people who need the help of a Sears tax-preparation
expert to distinguish between their first and last s.  Here's the
complete text:

"(1) How much did you make?  (AMOUNT)
(2) How much did we here at the government take out?  (AMOUNT)
(3) Hey!  Sounds like we took too much!  So we're going to
     send an official government check f (ONE-FIFTEENTH OF
     THE AMOUNT WE TOOK) directly to the (YOUR LAST NAME)
     household at (YOUR ADDRESS), f you to spend in any way
     you please! Which just goes to show you, (YOUR FIRST

A famous Lisp Hacker noticed an Undergraduate sitting in front of a Xerox
1108, trying to edit a complex Klone netwk via a r. Wanting to
help, the Hacker clicked one of the nodes in the netwk with the mouse,
and asked "what do you see?" Very earnestly, the Undergraduate replied "I
see a curs."  Hacker then quickly pressed the boot toggle at the back
of the keyboard, while simultaneously hitting the Undergraduate over the head
with a thick Interlisp Manual.   Undergraduate was then Enlightened.

A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head.  
green earfs, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that
grew in the ears themselvse, stuck out on either side like turn signals

upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H. Holmes department

of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be

			-- Gifts f Men --

Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional ice
hockey is so popular -- so buying gifts f them is easy.  But you should
never buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the clothes they
will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  F example, your average
man has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only three of them.  He has learned,
through humiliating trial and err, that if he wears any of the other 81
ties, his wife will probably laugh at him ("You're not going to wear THAT
tie with that suit, are you?"). So he has narrowed it down to three safe
ties, and has gone several years without being laughed at.  If you give him
a new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.

If you want to give a man something practical, consider tires.  Me than
once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got f a new set of tires.

A serious public debate about the validity of astrology?  A serious believer
in the White House?  Two of them?  Give me a break.  What stifled my laughter
is that the image fits.  Reagan has always exhibited a fey indifference toward
science.  Facts, like numbers, roll off his back.  And we've all come to
accept it.  This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not
that long ago, it was Reagan's suppt of Creationism....Creationists actually
got equal time with evolutionists.   public was supposed to be open-minded
to the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were
scientific colleagues....It has been clear f a long time that the president
is averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American
turf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns
into a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience,  even nonsense.   same

laetrile to eye of newt to the movment of planets.  We lose the capacity to
make rational -- scientific -- judgments.  It's all the same.

In the midst of one of the wildest parties he'd ever been to, the young man 
noticed a very prim and pretty girl sitting quietly apart from the rest of
the revelers.  Approaching her, he introduced himself and, after some quiet
conversation, said, "I'm afraid you and I don't really fit in with this
jaded group.  Why don't I take you home?""
	"Fine," said the girl, smiling up at him demurely.  "Where do you live?"

It happened long ago
In the new magic land
 Indians and the buffalo    
Existed hand in hand
 Indians needed food
y need skins f a roof
 only took what they needed
And the buffalo ran loose
But then came the white man
With his thick and empty head
He couldn't see past his billfold
He wanted all the buffalo dead
It was sad, oh so sad.
