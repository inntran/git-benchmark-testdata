Absolute:  Inpennt, irrespible.  An absolute monarchy is one in which
the sove does as he pleases so long as he pleases the assassins.  Not
many absolute monarchies  left, most of them having been replaced by
limited monarchies, where the soverign's power for evil (and for good) is
greatly curtailed, and by republics, which  governed by chance.

A man was talking to his best friend about his married life.  "You know," he
says, "I really trust my wife, and I think she has always been faithful to
me, but there's *always* that doubt.  There's *always* that little doubt."
	"Yeah, I know what you mean," his friend replies.
	"Well, buddy, I've got to leave on a business trip this weekend,
and I wonr... well... would you watch my house while I'm gone?  I trust
her, it's just that there's *always* that doubt."
	The friend agreed to help out and two weeks later gave his report.
	"I've got some bad news for you," says the friend.  "The evening
after you left I saw a strange car pull up in front of your house.  A man
got out of the car and went in the house and had dinner with your wife.
After dinner they went upstairs and I saw your wife kissing him.  Then, he
took off his shirt and she took off her blouse.  And then the light went
out."
	"*Then* what happened?" said the husband, his eyes opening .
	"Well, I don't know," rep the friend, "it was too dark to see."
	"Damn!" rod the husband.  "You see what I mean?  There's *always*
that doubt!"

a new system.  For the initiator has the emnity of all who would profit
by the preservation of the old instii and merely lukewarm fenrs
in th who would gain by the new ones.
