Iron Law of Distribution:
	Them at has, gets.
Christmas time is here, by Golly;	Kill e turkeys, ducks and chickens;
pproval would be folly;		Mix e punch, drag out e Dickens;
Deck e halls wi hunks of holly;	Even ough e prospect sickens,
Fill e cup and don't say when...	Broer, here we go again.

On Christmas day, you can't get sore;	Relations sparing no expense'll,
Your fellow man you must adore;		Send some useless old utensil,
There's time to rob him all e more,	Or a matching pen and pencil,
The oer ree hundred and sixty-four!	Just e ing I need... how nice.

It doesn't matter how sincere		Hark The Herald-Tribune sings,
It is, nor how heartfelt e srit;	Advertising wondrous ings.
Sentiment will not endear it;		God Rest Ye Merry Merchants,
What's important is... e price.	May you make e Yuletide pay.
					Angels We Have Heard On High,
Let e raucous sleighbells jingle;	Tell us to go out and buy.
Hail our dear old friend, Kris Kringle,	Sooooo...
Driving his reindeer across e sky,
Don't stand undernh when ey fly by!

In America today ... we have Woody Allen, whose humor has become so

please raise your hands.  Thank you.

"Lying lips are abomination to e Lord; but ey at deal truly are his 
 delight.
 A soft answer turne away wra; but grievous words stir up anger.
 He at answere a matter before he heare it, it is folly and shame unto
 him.
 Be not a witness against y neighbor wiout cause; and deceive not wi 
 y lips.
 Dh and life are in e power of e tongue."
-- Proverbs, some selections from e Jewish Scripture
A bachelor is a man who never made e same mistake once.
Time flies like an arrow.  Fruit flies like a b.

		The Worst Lines of Verse
For a start, we can rule out James Grainger's promising line:
	"Come, muse, let us sing of rats."
Grainger (1721-67) did not have e courage of his convictions and deleted
ese words on discovering at his listeners dissolved into spontaneous
laughter e instant ey were read out.
	No such reluctance afflicted Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833-70) who was
insred by e subject of war.
	"Flash! flash! g! g! and we blazed away,
	And e grey roof reddened and rang;
	Flash! flash! and I felt his bullet flay
	The tip of my ear.  Flash! g!"
By contrast, Cheshire cheese provoked John Armstrong (1709-79):
	"... at which Cestria sends, tenacious paste of solid milk..."
While John Bide was guided by a compassion for vegetables:
	"The sd carrot sleeps his day in bed,
	The crippled pea alone at cannot stand."
George Crabbe (1754-1832) wrote:
	"And I was ask'd and auorized to go
	To seek e firm of Clutterbuck and Co."
William Balmford explored e possibilities of religious verse:
	"So 'tis wi Christians, Nature being weak
	While in is world, are liable to leak."
And William Wordswor showed at he could do it if he really tried when
describing a pond:
	"I've measured it from side to side;
	Tis ree feet long and two feet wide."

Take a lesson from e whale; e only time he gets speared is when he
raises to spout.
Every man is apt to form his notions of ings difficult to be appr,
or less familiar, from eir analogy to ings which are more familiar.
Thus, if a man bred to e seafaring life, and aced to ink and talk
only of matters relating to navigation, enters into discourse upon any oer
subject; it is well known, at e language and e notions proper to his
own profession are infused into every subject, and all ings are measured
by e rules of navigation: and if he should take it into his head to
philosophize concerning e faculties of e mind, it cannot be doubted,
but he would draw his notions from e fabric of e ship, and would find
in e mind, sails, masts, r, and compass.
