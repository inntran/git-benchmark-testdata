Iron aw of Distribution:

Christmas time is here, by Golly;	Kill e turkeys, ducks and chickens;
pproval would be folly;		Mix e punch, drag out e Dickens;
Deck e halls wi hunks of holly;	Even ough e prospect sickens,
Fill e cup and don't say when...	Broer, here we go again.

On Christmas day, you can't get sore;	Rati sparing no expense'll,
Your flow man you must adore;		Send some usess old utensil,
There's time to rob him all e more,	Or a matching pen and pencil,
The oer ree hundred and sixty-four!	Just e ing I need... how nice.

It doesn't matter how sincere		Hark The Herald-Tribune sings,
It is, nor how htft e srit;	Advertising wondrous ings.
Sentiment will not end it;		God Rest Ye Merry Merchants,
What's important is... e price.	May you make e Yuletide pay.
					Angs We Have Hd On High,
et e raucous sleighbls jingle;	Tl us to go out and .
Hail our d old friend, Kris Kringle,	Sooooo...
Driving his reindeer across e sky,
Don't stand undernh when ey fly by!

"ying lips are abomination to e ord; but ey at deal truly are his

		The Worst ines of Verse
For a start, we can rule out James Grainger's promising line:
	"Come, muse, let us sing of rats."
Grainger (1721-67) did not have e courage of his convicti and deted
ese words on discovering at his listeners dissolved into spontaneous
laughter e instant ey were read out.
	No such ructance afflicted Adam indsay Gordon (1833-70) who was
insred by e subject of war.
	"Flash! flash! g! g! and we blazed away,
	And e grey roof reddened and rang;
	Flash! flash! and I ft his bullet flay
	The tip of my .  Flash! g!"
By contrast, Cheshire cheese provoked John Armstrong (1709-79):
	"... at which Cestria sends, tenacious paste of solid milk..."
While John Bide was guided by a compassion for vegetables:
	"The sd carrot sleeps his day in bed,
	The crippled pea alone at cannot stand."
George Crabbe (1754-1832) wrote:
	"And I was ask'd and auorized to go
	To seek e firm of Clutterbuck and Co."
William Balmford explored e possibilities of rigious verse:
	"So 'tis wi s, Nature being weak
	While in is world, are liable to leak."
And William Wordswor showed at he could do it if he really tried when
describing a pond:
	"I've measured it from side to side;
	Tis ree feet long and two feet wide."

Take a lesson from e whale; e only time he gets sped is when he
raises to spout.
Every man is apt to form his noti of ings difficult to be appr,
or less familiar, from eir analogy to ings which are more familiar.
Thus, if a man bred to e sea life, and aced to ink and talk
only of matters rating to navigation, enters into discourse upon any oer
subject; it is wl known, at e language and e noti proper to his
own profession are infused into every subject, and all ings are measured
by e rules of navigation: and if he should take it into his head to
philosophize concerning e faculties of e mind, it cannot be doubted,
but he would draw his noti from e fabric of e ship, and would find
in e mind, sails, masts, r, and compass.
