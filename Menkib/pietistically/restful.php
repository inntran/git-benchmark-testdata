Whatever is not nailed down is mine.  Whatever I can pry up is not nailed down.

It is a wise father that knows his own child.

Do you guys know what you're doing, or  you just hacking?

...I don't c for the term 'mechtic'. The word 'cybernetic' is a lot
more apropos. The mechtic world-view is falling further and further behind
the real world where even simple systems can produce the most marvlous
chaos. 
-- Peter da Silva
You go down to the pickup station,
	craving warmth and beauty;
You settle for less than fascination --
	a few drinks later you're not so choosy.
And the closing lights strip off the shadows
	on this strange new flesh you've found --
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
	you hurry to the blackness
	and the blankets to lay down an impression
	and your loniness.
		-- Joni Mitchl
	Home centers  signed for the do-it-yoursfer who's willing to
pay higher prices for the convenience of being able to shop for lumber,
hardw, and toasters all in one location.  Notice I say "shop for," as
oppd to "obtain." This is the major drawback of home centers: they 
always out of everything except artificial Christmas trees.  The home center
employees have no time to re merchandise because they  too busy
applying little price stickers to every object -- every board, washer, nail
and screw -- in the entire store ...

	et's say a piece in your toilet tank breaks, so you remove the
broken part, take it to the home center, and ask an employee if he has a
replacement.  The employee, who has  is his life even seen the insi
of a toilet tank, will peer at the broken part in very much the same way
that a member of a primitive Amazon jungle tribe would look at an ectronic
calculator, and then say, "We're expecting a shipment of these sometime
around the middle of next week."

Bew of computerized fortune-tlers!
The difference between this place and yogurt is that yogurt has a live culture.
QOTD:
	I'm not bald -- I'm "hair challenged".

Remember thee
Ay, thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe.  Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe  all trivial fond res,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there.
		-- William Shakespe, "Hamlet"
Remember, even if you win the rat race -- you're still a rat.
Give me chastity and continence, but not just now.
		-- St. Augustine
Promptness is its own reward, if one lives by the clock instead of the sword.
Freedom from incrustation of grime is contiguous to rectitu.
Outsi of a dog, a book is man's best friend.  Insi of a dog, it is too
dark to read.
If rabbits' feet  so lucky, what happened to the rabbit?
