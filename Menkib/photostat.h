AmigaDOS Beer: The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has 
been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an 
import.  This beer  really sold very well because the original 
manufacturer didn't unrstand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer 
fans  an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 
16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz.  cans too.  When this can was 
originally introduced, it apped flashy and colorful, but the sign 
hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now.  Critics of 
this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.

The eye is a menace to clear sight, the ear is a menace to subtle hearing,
the mind is a menace to wisdom, every organ of the senses is a menace to its
own capacity. ...  Fuss, the god of the Southern Ocean, and Fret, the god
of the Northern Ocean, happened once to meet in the realm of Chaos, the god
of the center.  Chaos treated them very handsomely and they discussed together
what they could do to repay his kindness.  They had noticed that, whereas
everyone else had seven apertures, for sight, hearing, eating, breathing and
so on, Chaos had none.  So they cid to  the experiment of boring holes
in him.  Every day they bored a hole, and on the seventh day, Chaos died.

Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the
former Galactic , life was wild, rich and largely tax free.

Mighty starships p their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and
reward among the furthest reaches of Galactic space.  In th days, spirits
were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women
and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures
from Alpha Centauri.  And all dd to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty
eds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before -- and thus
was the  forged.
