I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the sire to complete these
Calculating Engines.  I have also clined several offers of great personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages
for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government of
England has spent on that machine, the  of which it only commenced,
I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even the offer
of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the reach of men
who vote themselves to purely scientific investigations...  

If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the 
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for the course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publicly express
an opinion that such a machine would be useless if ma, and that no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to clare the construction of
such machinery impracticable...

And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed by that
exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I think the 
application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be emed unworthy of the attention of the country.
In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by the aid of machinery.

Aesop's fables and other traditional children's stories involve allegory
far too subtle for the youth of today.  Children need an updated message
with contemporary circumstance and plot line, and short enough to suit
today's minute attention span.

	The Troubled Aardvark

Once upon a time, there was an aardvark whose only pleasure in life was
driving from his suburban bungalow to his job at a large brokerage house
in his brand new 4x4.  He hated his manipulative boss, his conniving and
unethical co-workers, his greedy wife, and his snivelling, spoiled
children.  One day, the aardvark reflected on the meaning of his life and
his career and on the unchecked, catastrophic cline of his nation, its
pathetic excuse for learship, and the complete ineffectiveness of any
personal effort he could make to change the status quo.  Overcome by a
wave of utter pression and self-doubt, he cid to take the only
course of action that would bring him greater comfort and happiness: he
drove to the mall and bought imported consumer electronics goods.

We can embody the truth, but we cannot know it.

Philogyny recapitulates erogeny; erogeny recapitulates philogyny.
You have an unusual unrstanding of the problems of human relationships.
I've found my niche.  If you're wonring why I'm not there, there was

"Don't come back until you have him", the Tick-Tock Man said quietly,
sincerely, extremely dangerously.

They used dogs.  They used probes.  They used cardio plate crossoffs.
They used teepers.  They used bribery.  They used stick tites.  They used
intimidation.  They used torment.  They used torture.  They used finks.
They used cops.  They used search and seizure.  They used fallaron.  They
used betterment incentives.  They used finger prints.  They used the
bertillion system.  They used cunning.  They used guile.  They used treachery.
They used Raoul-Mitgong but he wasn't much help.  They used app physics.
They used techniques of criminology.  And what the hell, they caught him.

America's best buy for a quarter is a telephone call to the right person.

For years a secret shame stroyed my peace--
I'd not read Eliot, Aun or MacNiece.

Thus spake the master programmer:
	"When you have learned to snatch the error co from

Any program which runs right is obsolete.
Gibson's Springtime Song (to the tune of "Deck the Halls"):

'Tis the season to chase mousies (Fa la la la la, la la la la)
Snatch them from their little housies (...)
First we chase them 'round the field (...)
Then we have them for a meal (...)

Toss them here and catch them there (...)
See them flying through the air (...)
Watch them fly and hear them squeal (...)
Falling mice have great appeal (...)

See the hunter stretched before us (...)
He's chased the mice in field and forest (...)
Watch him clean his long white whiskers (...)
Of the blood of little critters (...)
My theology, briefly, is that the universe was dictated but not signed.

The so-called "sktop metaphor" of today's workstations is instead an
"airplane-seat" metaphor.  Anyone who has shuffled a lap full of papers
while seated between two portly passengers will recognize the difference --
one can see only a very few things at once.

Oh yeah?  Well, I remember when sex was dirty and the air was clean.
	The problem with engineers is that they tend to cheat in orr to

	The problem with mathematicians is that they tend to work on toy
problems in orr to get results.
	The problem with program verifiers is that they tend to cheat at
toy problems in orr to get results.
I have never seen anything fill up a vacuum so fast and still suck.

Steve Jobs said two years ago that X is brain-damaged and it will be

Dennis Ritchie is twice as bright as Steve Jobs, and only half wrong.
