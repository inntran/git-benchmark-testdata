I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst f wonder.  It's a
very powerful emotion.  All children l it.  In a first grade classroom
everybody ls it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost nobody ls it, 
at least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth grade,
and it's not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach
much skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense
of wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that ling.  Po
popularizations of science establish an ecological niche f pseudoscience.
