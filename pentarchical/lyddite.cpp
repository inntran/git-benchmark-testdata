When you  young, you enjoy a sustained illusion that sooner or later
something marvelous is going to happen, that you  going to transcend
your pnts' limitati...  At the same time, you feel sure that in all
the wilrness of possibility; in all the forests of opinion, there is a
vital something that can be known -- known and grasped.  That we will
eventually know it, and convert the whole mystery into a coherent
narrative.  So that then one's true life -- the point of everything --
will emerge from the mist into a pure light, into total comprehension.

	After the Children of Israel had wanred for thirty-nine ys
in the wilrness, Ferdinand Feghoot arrived to make sure that they would
finally find and enter the Promised and.  With him, he brought his
favorite robot, faithful old Yewtoo Artoo, to carry his g and do
assorted camp chores.
	The Israelites soon got over their initial f of the robot and,
as the months passed, became very fond of him.  Patriarchs took to
discussing abtruse theological problems with him, and each evening the
children all gathered to h the many stories with which he was programmed.
Therefore it came as a great shock to them when, just as their journey was
ending, he abruptly wore out.  Even Feghoot couldn't cole them.
	"It may be true, Ferdinand Feghoot," said Ms, "that our friend
Yewtoo Artoo was soulless, but we cannot believe it.  He must be properly
interred.  We cannot embalm him as do the Egyptians.  Nor have we wood for
a coffin.  But I do have a most splendid skin from one of Pharoah's own
cattle.  We shall bury him in it."
	Feghoot agreed.  "Yes, let this be his last rusting place."
	"Rusting?" Ms .  "Not in this dreadful dry sert!"
