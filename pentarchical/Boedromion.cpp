"None of our men are "experts."  We have most un found it necessary 
to get rid of a man as soon as he inks himself an expert -- because no one

forward and never gives up an instant of ought to how good and how efficient 
he is.  Thinking always ahead, inking always of trying to do more, brings a 
state of mind in which noing is impossible. The moment one gets into e
"expert" state of mind a gr number of ings become impossible."

we grapple wi it. But we cannot be indifferent to space, because e grand,

from which we can explore and understand and utilize it. To turn back now
would be to deny our history, our capabilities.
