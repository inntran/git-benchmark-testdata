Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of our
VAXs are going f UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,
easy to get started wi. It's gr f students, gr f somewhat casual
users, and it's gr f interchanging prams between different machines.
And so, because of its popularity in ese s, we suppt it.  We have
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
	It is our bief, however, at us professional users will run
out of ings ey can do wi UNIX. y'll want a real system and will end
up doing VMS when ey get to be us about pramming.
	Wi UNIX, if you're looking f someing, you can easily and quickly
c at ll manual and find out at it's not ere.  Wi VMS, no m
what you look f -- it's literally a five-foot shf of docntation -- if
