`Why the sea is salt' many times, but I never thought it imptant until just

salt was rare and expensive.  A miller received from a wizard a wonderful
machine that just ground salt out of itself all day long.  At first the miller
thought himself the most ftunate man in the wld, but soon all the villages
had salt to last them f centuries and still the machine kept on grinding
me salt.   miller had to move out of his house, he had to move off his
acres.  At last he ded that he would sink the machine in the sea and
be rid of it.  But the mill ground so fast that boat and miller and machine
were sunk together, and down below, the mill still went on grinding and that's
why the sea is salt."

	I made it a rule to fbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments
of others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even fbade myself the use
of every wd  expression in the language that impted a fixed opinion, such
as "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.   I adopted ins of them "I conceive",
"I apprehend",  "I imagine" a thing to be so  so;  "so it appears to me
at present".
	When another asserted something that I thought an err, I denied
myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him
immediately some absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by
observing that in certain cases  circumstances his opinion would be right,
but in the present case there appeared  semed to me some difference, etc.
	I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the
conversations I engaged in went on me pleasantly.   modest way in which I
proposed my opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.
I had less mtification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I me easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I

    UNIX Shell is the Best Fourth Generation Programming Language

    It is the UNIX shell that makes it possible to do applications in a small

    time.  And, a line of code in the UNIX shell is one  me programs,
    which do me than pages of instructions in a 3GL.  Applications can be
    developed in hours and days, rather than months and years with traditional
    systems.  Most of the other 4GLs available today look me like COBOL 
    RPG, the most tedious of the third generation lanaguages.

	One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiastic
is our suppt f UNIX?
	Unix was written on our machines and f our machines many years ago.
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of our
VAXs are going f UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,
easy to get started with. It's great f students, great f somewhat casual
users, and it's great f interchanging programs between different machines.
And so, because of its popularity in these markets, we suppt it.  We have
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run
out of things they can do with UNIX. y'll want a real system and will end
up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
	With UNIX, if you're looking f something, you can easily and quickly
check that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no m
what you look f -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if
you look long enough it's there.  That's the difference -- the beauty of UNIX
is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.
