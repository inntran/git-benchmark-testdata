Around the turn of this century, a compr named Camille Saint-Saens wrote
a satirical zoological-fantasy called "e Carnaval s Animaux."  Asi from
one movement of this piece, "The Swan", Saint-Saens didn't allow this work
to be published or even performed until a y had elapsed after his ath.
(He died in 1921.)
	Most of us know the "Swan" movement rather well, with its smooth,
flowing cello melody against a calm background; but I've been having this
fantasy...
	What if he had written this piece with lyrics, as a song to be sung?
And, further, what if he had accompanied this song with a musical saw?  (This
instrument really does exist, often played by percussionists!)  Then the
piece would be better known as:
	SAINT-SAENS' SAW SONG "SWAN"!

The startling truth finally became appnt, and it was this: Numbers

The most exquisite peak in culinary art is ed when you do right by a
ham, for a ham, in the very nature of the process it has unrgone since last
it walked on its own feet, combines in its flavor the tang of smoky autumnal
woods, the maternal softness of thy fields livered of their crop children,
the wineyness of a late sun, the intimate kiss of fertilizing rain, and the
bite of fire.  You must slice it thin, almost as thin as this page you hold
in your hands.  The making of a ham dinner, like the making of a gentleman,
starts a long, long time before the event.

Harold had  wanted a woman so much in his life, upon overhing the
22-y-old beauty remark that he was too old and out of shape for her.  The
termined septuagenarian immediately embarked upon a rigorous self-improvement
program.  He had his face lifted, bought a toupee, ran five miles every day,
lifted weights and adopted a strict vegetarian diet.  Within months, the
rejuvenated man won the young woman's ht, and she agreed to marry him.
	On the way out of the chapel, however, Harold was fatally struck
by lightning.  Furious, he confronted Saint Peter at the ply gates.  "How
could you do this to me after all the pain I went through?"
	"To be honest, Harold," Saint Peter sheepishly rep, "I didn't
recognize you."

To date, the firm conclusi of Project Blue Book :
   1. no unintified flying object reported, investigated and evaluated
      by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our
      national security;
   2. there has been no evince submitted to or discovered by the Air
      Force that sightings categorized as UNIDENTIFIED represent
      technological velopments or s beyond the range of
      present-day scientific knowledge; and
   3. there has been no evince indicating that sightings categorized
      as UNIDENTIFIED  extraterrestrial vehicles.
