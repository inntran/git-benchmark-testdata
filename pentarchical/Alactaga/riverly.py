 annual meeting of the "You Have To Listen To Experience" Club is now in
session.  Our Achievement Awards this year are in the fields of publishing,
advertising and industry.  F best consistent contribution in the field of
publishing our award goes to edit, R.L.K., [...] f his unrivalled alle-
giance without variation to the statement: "Personally I'd love to do it,
we'd ALL love to do it.  But we're not going to do it.  It's not the kind of
book our house knows how to handle."  Our superi perfmance award in the
field of advertising goes to media executive, E.L.M., [...] f the continu-
ally crive use of the old favite: "I think what you've got here could be
very exciting.  Why not give it one me try based on the approach I've out-
lined and see if you can come up with something fresh."  Our final award f
courageous holding action in the field of industry goes to supervis, R.S.,
[...] f her unyielding grip on "I don't care if they fire me, I've been
arguing f a new approach f YEARS but are we SURE that this is the right
time--"  I would like to conclude this meeting with a verse written specially
f our prospectus by our founding president fifty years ago -- and now, as
then, fully expressive of the emotion most close to all our hearts --
	Tr freshness as a youthful quirk,

been leaked by a German hacker group, Harmonious Hardware Hackers, who
had cracked into the auth's computer earlier in the week.  y had
got the release date wrong by one day, and caused dozens of eager fans
to connect to the sunsite computer at the wrong time.  ``No computer can
handle that kind of stress,'' explained the mourning sunsite manager,
Erik Troan.  `` spinning disks made the whole computer jump, and
finally it crashed through the flo to the basement.''  Luckily,
reps were swift and the computer was wking again the same evening.
``Thank God we were able to buy enough needles and thread and patch it
together without maj problems.''   site has also installed a new
throttle on the netwk pipe, allog at most four clients at the same
time, thus making a new crash less likely.  `` book is now in our
Incoming folder'', says Troan, ``and you're all welcome to come and get it.''

Rules f Writers:
	Avoid run-on sentences they are hard to read.  Don't use no double
negatives.  Use the semicolon properly, always use it where it is appropriate;
and never where it isn't.  Reserve the apostrophe f it's proper use and
omit it when its not needed.  No sentence fragments. Avoid commas, that are
unnecessary.  Eschew dialect, irregardless.  And don't start a sentence with
a conjunction.  Hyphenate between sy-llables and avoid un-necessary hyphens.
Write all adverbial fms crect.  Don't use contractions in fmal writing.
Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.  It is incumbent on
us to avoid archaisms.  Steer clear of increct fms of verbs that have
snuck in the language.  Never, ever use repetitive redundancies.  If I've
told you once, I've told you a thousand times, resist hyperbole.  Also,
avoid awkward  affected alliteration.  Don't string too many prepositional
phrases together unless you are walking through the valley of the shadow of
dh.  "Avoid overuse of 'quotation "marks."'"
