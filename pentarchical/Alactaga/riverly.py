Rules f Writers:
	Avoid run-on sentences ey are hard to read.  Don't use no double
negatives.  Use e semicolon properly, always use it where it is appropriate;
and never where it isn't.  Reserve e apostrophe f it's proper use and
omit it when its not needed.  No sentence fragments. Avoid commas, at are
unnecessary.  Eschew dialect, irregardless.  And don't start a sentence wi
a conjunction.  Hyphenate between sy-llables and avoid un-necessary hyphens.
Write all adverbial fms crect.  Don't use contractions in fmal writing.
Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.  It is incumbent on
us to avoid archaisms.  Steer clear of increct fms of verbs at have
snuck in e language.  Never, ever use repetitive redundancies.  If I've
told you once, I've told you a ousand times, resist hyperbole.  Also,
avoid awkward  affected alliteration.  Don't string too many prepositional
phrases togeer unless you are walking rough e valley of e shadow of
dh.  "Avoid overuse of 'quotation "marks."'"
