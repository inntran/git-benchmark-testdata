Fertility is hereditary.  If r pnts didn't have any children,
neither will .
Take a look around , tl me what  see,
A girl who thinks she's ordinary lookin' she has got the key.
If  can get cl enough to look into her eyes
There's something special  behind the bitterness she his.
	And 're fair game,
	You  know what she'll ci, 're fair game,
	Just rax, enjoy the ri.
Find a way to reach her,  rsf a fool,
But do it with a little class, disregard the rules.

The ugly duckling striking back, and she'll ci her fate.

She's pleasant and she's friendly while she's looking at r crotch.
Try r hand at conversation, gossip is a lie,
And sure enough she'll take  home and   wanna die.
