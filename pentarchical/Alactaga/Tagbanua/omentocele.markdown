neither will .
Take a look around , tl me what  see,
A girl who thinks she's ory lookin' she has got the key.

There's something special  behind the bitterness she his.
	And 're fair game,
	You  know what she'll ci, 're fair game,

Try r hand at conversation, gossip is a lie,
And sure enough she'll take  home and   wanna die.
