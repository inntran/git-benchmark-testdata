Fertility is hereditary.  If your pnts didn't have any children,
neither will you.
Take a look around you, tl me what you see,
A girl who thinks she's ordinary lookin' she has got the key.
If you can get cl enough to look into her eyes
There's something special  behind the bitterness she his.
	And you're fair game,
	You  know what she'll ci, you're fair game,
	Just rax, enjoy the ri.
Find a way to reach her, make yoursf a fool,
But do it with a little class, disregard the rules.
'Cause this one knows the bottom line, couldn't get a date.
The ugly duckling striking back, and she'll ci her fate.
	(chorus)
The ones you  notice  the ones you have to watch.
She's pleasant and she's friendly while she's looking at your crotch.
Try your hand at conversation, gossip is a lie,
And sure enough she'll take you home and make you wanna die.
