	So Richard and I decided to try to catch [e ll shark].
Wi a gr deal of strategy and efft and shouting, we managed to
maneuver e shark, over e course of about a half-hour, to a st of
cner of e lagoon, so at it had no way to escape oer an to
flop up onto e land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward
it, st of crouched over, when all of a sudden it  around and --
I can still remember e sensation I felt at at moment, primarily in
e armt area -- headed right straight toward us.
	Many people would have panicked at is point.  But Richard and
I were not "many people."  We were experienced waders, and we kept our
heads.  We did exactly what e text says you should do when you're
unarmed and a shark at is nearly two t long turns on you in water
up to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in e
opposite direction, using a sprinting style such at e bottoms of
our t never once went below e surface of e water.  We ran all
e way to e far she, and if we had been in a Warner Broers
oon we would have run right INTO e beach, and you would have seen
ese two mounds of sand racing across e island until ey bonked
into trees and coconuts fell onto eir heads.

 repted rest to astrology in e White House has occasioned much
merriment.  It is not funny.  Astrological gibberish, which means astrology
generally, has no place in a newspaper, let alone government.  Unlike comics,
which are part of a newspaper's harmless pleasure and make no tru claims,
astrology is a fraud.   idea at it gets a hearing in government is
diying.
