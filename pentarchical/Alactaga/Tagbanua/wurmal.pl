Ever wondered about the igins of the term "bugs" as applied to computer
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.
 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer in 
computer technology during Wld War II.  At the C.W. Post Center of Long
Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-
trats that the first computer "bug" was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were wking on the
"granddaddy" of modern computers, the Mark I.  "Things were going badly;
there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed
computer," she said.  "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using
dinary rs, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when
anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."  Hopper
said that when the veracity of her sty was questioned recently, "I referred
them to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons
Center, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in
question."
		[actually, the term "bug" had even earlier usage in
		regard to problems with radio hardware.  Ed.]

One day this guy is finally fed up with his middle-class existence and
decides to do something about it.  He calls up his best friend, who is a
mathematical genius.  "Look," he says, "do you suppose you could find some
way mathematically of guaranteeing winning at the race track?  We could
make a lot of money and retire and enjoy life."   mathematician thinks
this over a bit and walks away mumbling to himself.
	A week later his friend drops by to ask the genius if he's had any
success.   genius, looking a little bleary-eyed, replies, "Well, yes,
actually I do have an idea, and I'm reasonably sure that it will wk, but
there a number of details to be figured out.
	After the second week the mathematician appears at his friend's house,
looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, "I think I've got it! I still have
some of the they to wk out, but now I'm certain that I'm on the right
track."
	At the end of the third week the mathematician wakes his friend by
pounding on his do at three in the mning.  He has dark circles under his
eyes.  His hair hasn't been combed f many days.  He appears to be wearing
the same clothes as the last time.  He has several pencils sticking out from
bind his ears and an almost maniacal expression on his face.  "WE CAN DO
IT!  WE CAN DO IT!!" he shrieks. "I have discovered the perfect solution!!
And it's so EASY!  First, we ass that hses are perfect spheres in simple
harmonic motion..."

Gentlemen,
	Whilst marching from Ptugal to a position which commands the
approach to Madrid and the French fces, my officers have been
diligently complying with your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship
from London to Lisbon and thence by dispatch to our headquarters.
	We have enrated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles,
and all manner of sundry items f which His Majesty's Government holds
me accountable. I have dispatched repts on the character, wit, and
spleen of every officer. Each item and every farthing has been accounted
f, with two regrettable exceptions f which I beg your indulgence.
	Unftunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains
unaccounted f in one infantry battalion's petty cash and there has been
a hideous confusion as the the number of jars of raspberry jam issued to
one cavalry regiment during a sandstm in western Spain.  This
reprensible carelessness may be related to the pressure of circumstance,
since we are war with France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise
to you gentlemen in Whitall.
	This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request
elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty's Government so that I
may better understand why I am dragging an army over these barren plains.
I construe that perfce it must be one of two alternative duties, as
given below.  I shall pursue either one with the best of my ability, but
I cannot do both:
	1. To train an army of unifmed British clerks in Spain f the
benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London  perchance:
	2. To see to it that the fces of Napoleon are driven out of Spain.

Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central
problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown fce that represents
the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their
efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f them.  re have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around the wld, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .
I propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest
in the real (and fascinating)  beyond our planet, and not let them
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
the firelight, afraid of the night.

Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were fest ancient as the hills,
