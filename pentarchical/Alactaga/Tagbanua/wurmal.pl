Ever wondered about e igins of e term "bugs" as applied to computer
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace  Hopper has firsand explanation.
 74-y-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a oneer in 
computer technology during Wld War II.  At e C.W. Post Center of ong
Island University, Hopper told a group of ong Island public school adminis-
trats at e first computer "bug" was a real bug--a mo.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were wking on e
"granddaddy" of modern computers, e Mark I.  "Things were going badly;
ere was someing wrong in one of e circuits of e long glass-enclosed
computer," she said.  "Finally, someone located e trouble spot and, using
dinary rs, removed e problem, a two-inch mo.  From en on, when
anying went wrong wi a computer, we said it had bugs in it."  Hopper
said at when e veracity of her sty was questioned recently, "I referred
em to my 1945 log , now in e collection of e Naval Sur Weap
Center, and ey found e remains of at mo taped to e page in
question."
		[actually, e term "bug" had even lier usage in
		regard to problems wi radio hardw.  Ed.]

	A week later his friend drops by to ask e genius if he's had any
success.   genius, looking a little bly-eyed, replies, "Wl, yes,

looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, "I ink I've got it! I still have
some of e ey to wk out, but now I'm certain at I'm on e

	At e end of e ird week e maematician wakes his friend by

Gentlemen,
	Whilst marching from Ptugal to a position which commands e
approach to Madrid and e French fces, my officers have been
diligently complying wi your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship
from ondon to isbon and ence by dispatch to our headquarters.
	We have enrated our saddles, brs, tents and tent poles,
and all manner of sundry items f which His Majesty's Government holds
me accountable. I have dispatched repts on e character, wit, and
spleen of every officer. Each item and every  has been accounted
f, wi two regrettable excepti f which I beg your indulgence.

reprensible cssness may be rated to e pressure of circumstance,
since we  war wi France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise
to you gentlemen in Whitall.
	This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request
ucidation of my instructi from His Majesty's Government so at I
may better understand why I am dragging an army over ese  plains.
I ctrue at perfce it must be one of two alternative duties, as

I cannot do bo:

Even if we put all ese nagging oughts [four embarrassing questi about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would e positi of cestial objects at e moment of bir have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would trav from e planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our devopment  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculati by astrologers can disguise is central
problem wi astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechm by which
cestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue at ere may be a still unknown fce at represents
e astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predicti -- like ose
of any scientific fid -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such cful tests of eir
efficacy, so in e last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f em.  re have been dozens of wl-designed
tests all around e wld, and astrology has failed every one of em. . . .
I propose at we let ose beckoning lights in e sky awaken our interest
in e real (and fascinating)  beyond our planet, and not let em
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
e fi, afraid of e night.
