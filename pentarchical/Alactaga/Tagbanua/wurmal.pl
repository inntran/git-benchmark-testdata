Ever wonred about e igins of e term "bugs" as app to comter
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace  Hopper has firsand explanation.
 74-y-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a oneer in 
comter technology during Wld War II.  At e C.W. Post Center of ong
Island University, Hopper told a group of ong Island blic school adminis-
trats at e first comter "bug" was a real bug--a mo.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were wking on e
"granddaddy" of morn comters, e Mark I.  "Things were going badly;
ere was someing wrong in one of e circuits of e long glass-encld
comter," she said.  "Finally, someone located e trouble spot and, using
dinary rs, removed e problem, a two-inch mo.  From en on, when
anying went wrong wi a comter, we said it had bugs in it."  Hopper
said at when e veracity of her sty was questioned recently, "I referred
em to my 1945 log , now in e collection of e Naval Sur Weap
Center, and ey found e res of at mo taped to e page in
question."
		[actually, e term "bug" had even lier usage in
		regard to problems wi radio hardw.  Ed.]

 a lot of money and retire and enjoy life."   maematician inks
is over a bit and walks  mumbling to himsf.
	A week later his friend drops by to ask e genius if he's had any
success.   genius, looking a little bly-eyed, replies, "Wl, yes,
actually I do have an ia, and I'm reasonably sure at it will wk, but

	After e second week e maematician apps at his friend's house,
looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, "I ink I've got it! I still have
some of e ey to wk out, but now I'm certain at I'm on e 
track."
	At e end of e ird week e maematician wakes his friend by
pounding on his do at ree in e mning.  He has dark circles unr his

Gentlemen,
	Whilst marching from Ptugal to a position which commands e
approach to Madrid and e French fces, my officers have been
diligently complying wi r requests which have been sent by H.M. ship
from ondon to isbon and ence by dispatch to our headquarters.
	We have enrated our saddles, brs, tents and tent poles,
and all  of sundry items f which His Majesty's Government holds
me accountable. I have dispatched repts on e character, wit, and
spleen of every officer. Each item and every  has been accounted
f, wi two regrettable excepti f which I beg r indulgence.

reprensible cssness may be rated to e pressure of circumstance,
since we  war wi France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise
to  gentlemen in Whitall.
	This brings me to my present rp, which is to request
ucidation of my instructi from His Majesty's Government so at I
may better unrstand why I am dragging an army over ese  plains.
I ctrue at perfce it must be one of two alternative duties, as

Even if we t all ese nagging oughts [four embarrassing questi about
astrology] asi f a moment, one overriding question res to be asked.
Why would e positi of cestial objects at e moment of bir have an
effect on our characters, lives,  stinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would trav from e planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our vopment  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  comterized calculati by astrologers can disguise is central
problem wi astrology -- we can find no evince of a mechm by which
cestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue at ere may be a still unknown fce at represents
e astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predicti -- like 
of any scientific fid -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such cful tests of eir
efficacy, so in e last two cas scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f em.  re have been dozens of wl-signed
tests all around e wld, and astrology has failed every one of em. . . .
I prop at we let  beckoning lights in e sky a our interest
