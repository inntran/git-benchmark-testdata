Ever wondered about e igins of e term "bugs" as applied to computer
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsand explanation.
 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a oneer in 
computer technology during Wld War II.  At e C.W. Post Center of Long
Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-
trats at e first computer "bug" was a real bug--a mo.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were wking on e
"granddaddy" of modern computers, e Mark I.  "Things were going badly;
ere was someing wrong in one of e circuits of e long glass-enclosed
computer," she said.  "Finally, someone located e trouble spot and, using
dinary rs, removed e problem, a two-inch mo.  From en on, when
anying went wrong wi a computer, we said it had bugs in it."  Hopper
said at when e veracity of her sty was questioned recently, "I referred
em to my 1945 log , now in e collection of e Naval Surface Weapons
Center, and ey found e remains of at mo taped to e page in
question."
		[actually, e term "bug" had even earlier usage in
		regard to problems wi radio hardware.  Ed.]

One day is guy is finally fed up wi his middle-class existence and

make a lot of money and retire and enjoy life."   maematician inks
is over a bit and walks away mumbling to himself.
	A week later his friend drops by to ask e genius if he's had any
success.   genius, looking a little bleary-eyed, replies, "Well, yes,
actually I do have an idea, and I'm reasonably sure at it will wk, but
ere a number of details to be figured out.
	After e second week e maematician appears at his friend's house,
looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, "I ink I've got it! I still have
some of e ey to wk out, but now I'm certain at I'm on e right
track."
	At e end of e ird week e maematician wakes his friend by
pounding on his do at ree in e mning.  He has dark circles under his
eyes.  His h hasn't been combed f many days.  He appears to be wearing
e same cloes as e last time.  He has several pencils sticking out from
bind his ears and an almost maniacal expression on his face.  "WE CAN DO

And it's so EASY!  First, we ass at hses are perfect spheres in simple

Gentlemen,
	Whilst marching from Ptugal to a position which commands e
approach to Madrid and e French fces, my officers have been
diligently complying wi your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship
from London to Lisbon and ence by dispatch to our headquarters.
	We have enrated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles,
and all manner of sundry items f which His Majesty's Government holds
me accountable. I have dispatched repts on e character, wit, and
spleen of every officer. Each item and every faring has been accounted
f, wi two regrettable exceptions f which I beg your indulgence.
	Unftunately e sum of one shilling and ninepence remains
unaccounted f in one infantry battalion's petty cash and ere has been
a hideous confusion as e e number of jars of raspberry jam issued to
one cavalry regiment during a sandstm in western Spain.  This
reprensible carelessness may be related to e pressure of circumstance,
since we are war wi France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise
to you gentlemen in Whitall.
	This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request
elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty's Government so at I
may better understand why I am dragging an army over ese barren plains.
I construe at perfce it must be one of two alternative duties, as
given below.  I shall pursue eier one wi e best of my ability, but
I cannot do bo:
	1. To train an army of unifmed British clerks in Spain f e
benefit of e accountants and copy-boys in London  perchance:
	2. To see to it at e fces of Napoleon are driven out of Spain.

Even if we put all ese nagging oughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside f a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would e positions of celestial objects at e moment of bir have an
effect on our characters, lives,  destinies?  What fce  influence,
what st of energy would travel from e planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development  fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon  computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise is central
problem wi astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue at ere may be a still unknown fce at represents
e astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like ose
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of eir
efficacy, so in e last two decades scientists and statisticians have
 done such testing f em.  re have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around e wld, and astrology has failed every one of em. . . .
I propose at we let ose beckoning lights in e sky awaken our interest
in e real (and fascinating)  beyond our planet, and not let em
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
e firelight, afraid of e night.
