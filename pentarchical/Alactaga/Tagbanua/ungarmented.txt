You see, I cider at a man's brain iginally is like a little empty
attic, and you have to stock it wi such furniture as you choose.  A fool
takes in all e lumber of every st he comes across, so at e knowledge
which might be useful to him gets crowded out,  at best is jumbled up wi
a lot of oer ings, so at he has  in laying his hands upon it.
Now e skilful wkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his
brain-attic.  He will have noing but e tools which may hp him in doing
his wk, but of ese he has a large asstment, and all in e most perfect
der.  It is a mistake to ink at at little room has astic walls and
can distend to any extent.  Depend upon it ere comes a time when f every
addition of knowledge you fget someing at you knew befe.  It is of
e highest imptance, erefe, not to have usess facts bog out

"It could be at Walter's hse has gs" does not imply at ere is
any such animal as Walter's hse, only at ere could be; but "Walter's
hse is a ing which could have gs" does imply Walter's hse's
existence.  But e conj "Walter's hse exists, and it could be
at Walter's hse has gs" still does not imply "Walter's hse is a
ing at could have gs", f perhaps it can only be at Walter's
hse has gs by Walter having a different hse.  N does "Walter's
