Most people have two reasons f doing anything -- a good reason, and

Don't tell any big lies today.  Small ones can be just as effective.
You see, I consider that a man's brain iginally is like a little empty
attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.  A fool
takes in all the lumber of every st he comes across, so that the knowledge
which might be useful to him gets crowded out,  at best is jumbled up with
a lot of other things, so that he has difficulty in laying his hands upon it.
Now the skilful wkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his
brain-attic.  He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing
his wk, but of these he has a large asstment, and all in the most perfect
der.  It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and
can distend to any extent.  Depend upon it there comes a time when f every
addition of knowledge you fget something that you knew befe.  It is of
the highest imptance, therefe, not to have useless facts elbowing out
the useful ones.

"It could be that Walter's hse has wings" does not imply that there is
any such animal as Walter's hse, only that there could be; but "Walter's
hse is a thing which could have wings" does imply Walter's hse's
existence.  But the conjunction "Walter's hse exists, and it could be
that Walter's hse has wings" still does not imply "Walter's hse is a
thing that could have wings", f perhaps it can only be that Walter's
hse has wings by Walter having a different hse.  N does "Walter's
hse is a thing which could have wings" conversely imply "It could be that
Walter's hse has wings"; f it might be that Walter's hse could only
have wings by not being Walter's hse.

I would deny, though, that the fmula [Necessarily if some x has proy P
then some x has proy P] expresses a logical law, since P(x) could stand
f, let us say "x is a better logician than I am", and the statement "It is
necessary that if someone is a better logician than I am then someone is a
better logician than I am" is false because there need not have been any me.

says the hen adopted the kittens when they were but a few days old, and that

	Even people are changing.  y are so much younger than they used to
be when I was their age.  On  the other hand people my age are so much older

Cring computer software is always a demanding and painstaking
process -- an exercise in logic, clear expression, and almost fanatical
attention to detail.  It requires intelligence, dedication, and an
enmous amount of hard wk.  But, a certain amount of unpredictable
and often unrepable inspiration is what usually makes the difference
between adequacy and excellence.

	Risch's decision procedure f integration, not surprisingly,
uses a recursion on the number and type of the extensions from the
rational functions needed to represent the integrand.  Although the
algithm follows and critically depends upon the appropriate structure
of the input, as in the case of multivariate factization, we cannot
claim that the algithm is a natural one.  In fact, the cr of
differential algebra, Ritt, committed suicide in the early 1950's,
largely, it is claimed, because few paid attention to his wk.  Probably
he would have received me attention had he obtained the algithm as well.

A prominent broadcaster, on a big-game safari in Africa, was taken to a
watering hole where the life of the jungle could be observed. As he
looked down from his tree platfm and described the scene into his
tape recder, he saw two gnus grazing peacefully. So preoccupied were
they that they failed to observe the approach of a pride of lions led
by two magnificent specimens, obviously the leaders.  lions charged,
killed the gnus, and dragged them into the bushes where their feasting
could not be seen.  A little while later the two kings of the jungle
emerged and the radioman recded on his tape: "Well, that's the end of
the gnus and here, once again, are the head lions."
