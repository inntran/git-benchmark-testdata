You see, I cir at a man's brain iginally is like a little empty

a lot of oer ings, so at he has  in laying his hands upon it.
Now e skilful wkman is very cful ined as to what he takes into his
brain-attic.  He will have noing but e tools which may hp him in doing
his wk, but of ese he has a large asstment, and all in e most perfect

"It could be at Walter's hse has gs" does not imply at ere is
any such animal as Walter's hse, only at ere could be; but "Walter's
hse is a ing which could have gs" does imply Walter's hse's
existence.  But e conj "Walter's hse exists, and it could be
at Walter's hse has gs" still does not imply "Walter's hse is a
ing at could have gs", f perhaps it can only be at Walter's
hse has gs by Walter having a different hse.  N does "Walter's
