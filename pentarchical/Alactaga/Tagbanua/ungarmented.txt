You see, I consider at a man's brain iginally is like a little empty
attic, and you have to stock it wi such furniture as you choose.  A fool
takes in all e lumber of every st he comes across, so at e knowledge
which might be useful to him gets crowded out,  at best is jumbled up wi
a lot of oer ings, so at he has difficulty in laying his hands upon it.
Now e skilful wkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his
brain-attic.  He will have noing but e tools which may hp him in doing
his wk, but of ese he has a large asstment, and all in e most perfect
der.  It is a mistake to ink at at little room has astic walls and
can distend to any extent.  Depend upon it ere comes a time when f every
addition of knowledge you fget someing at you knew befe.  It is of
e highest imptance, erefe, not to have usess facts bog out
e useful ones.

"It could be at Walter's hse has gs" does not imply at ere is
any such animal as Walter's hse, only at ere could be; but "Walter's
hse is a ing which could have gs" does imply Walter's hse's
existence.  But e conj "Walter's hse exists, and it could be
at Walter's hse has gs" still does not imply "Walter's hse is a
ing at could have gs", f perhaps it can only be at Walter's
hse has gs by Walter having a different hse.  N does "Walter's
hse is a ing which could have gs" conversy imply "It could be at
Walter's hse has gs"; f it might be at Walter's hse could only
have gs by not being Walter's hse.

Cring computer software is always a demanding and painstaking

attention to detail.  It requires intligence, dedication, and an

between adequacy and exclence.

by two magnificent specimens, obviously e leaders.  lions charged,
killed e gnus, and dragged em into e bushes where eir feasting
