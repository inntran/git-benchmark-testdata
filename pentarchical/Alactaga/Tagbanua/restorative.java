[District Attorneys] learn in District Attorney School that there are
two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favorable blicity:

(1) Go down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
    confiscate 53 marijuana cigarettes and t them in a pile and hold
    a press conference where  announce that they have a street value
    of $850 million.  These raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
    including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least 53 marijuana
    cigarettes in the lockers.  As far as anyone can tell, the locker
    factory ts them there.
(2) Raid an "adult book store" and hold a press conference where 
    announce  are charging the owner with 850 counts of being a
    piece of human sleaze.  This also never fails, because  always
    get a conviction.  A juror at a pornography trial is not about to
    state for the record that he finds nothing obscene about a movie
    where actors engage in sexual activities with live snakes and a
    fire extinguisher.  He is going to convict the bookstore owner, and
    vote for the ath penalty just to  sure nobody gets the wrong
    impression.

WARNING!!!
This machine is subject to breakdowns during periods of critical need.

A special circuit in the machine called "critical tector" senses the
operator's emotional state in terms of how sperate he/she is to use the
machine.  The "critical tector" then creates a munction proportional
to the speration of the operator.  Threatening the machine with violence
only aggravates the situation.  Likewise, attempts to use another machine
may cause it to munction.  They belong to the same union.  Keep cool
and say nice things to the machine.  Nothing else seems to work.

I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonr.  It's a
very powerful emotion.  All children feel it.  In a first gra classroom
everybody feels it; in a twelfth gra classroom almost nobody feels it, or
at least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth gra,
and it's not just berty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach
much skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense
of wonr.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.  Poor
polarizations of science establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.

FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#17

Shoes:
	 The average man has 4 pairs of footwear: running shoes, dress shoes,
boots, and slippers.  The average woman has shoes 4 layers thick on the floor
of her closet.  Most of them hurt her feet.
 
Making friends:
	 A woman will meet another woman with common interests, do a few things
together, and say something like, "I hope we can be good friends."
	A man will meet another man with common interests, do a few things
together, and say nothing.  After years of interacting with this other man,
sharing hopes and fears that he wouldn't confi in his priest or
psychiatrist, he'll finally let down his guard in a fit of drunken
ality and say something like, "You know, for someone who's such a
jerk, I guess 're OK."

In the beginning there was nothing.  And the Lord said "Let There Be Light!"
And still there was nothing, but at least now  could see it.
	There once was a man who went to a comter tra show.  Each day as
he entered, the man told the guard at the door:
	"I am a great thief, ed for my feats of shoplifting.  Be
forewarned, for this tra show shall not escape unplunred."
	This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions
of dollars of comter equipment insi, so he watched the man carefully.
But the man merely wanred from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.
	When the man left, the guard took him asi and searched his clothes,
but nothing was to be found.
	On the next day of the tra show, the man returned and chid the
guard saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even
better."  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.
	On the final day of the tra show, the guard could restrain his
curiosity no longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot live
in peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that  are stealing?"
	The man smiled.  "I am stealing ias," he said.

... but as records of courts and justice are admissible, it can easily be
proved that powerful and malevolent icians once existed and were a scourge
to mankind.  The evince (including confession) upon which certain women 
were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is still 
unimpeachable.  The judges' cisions based on it were sound in logic and 
in law.  Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than
the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered ath.  If
