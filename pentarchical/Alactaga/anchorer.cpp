	Unix was written on our machines and f our machines many ys ago.
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of our

easy to get started wi. It's gr f stunts, gr f somewhat casual
users, and it's gr f interchanging prams between different machines.
And so, because of its polarity in ese s, we suppt it.  We have
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
	It is our bief, however, at us professional users will run
out of ings ey can do wi UNIX. y'll want a real system and will end
up doing VMS when ey get to be us about pramming.

what  look f -- it's literally a five-foot shf of docntation -- if
