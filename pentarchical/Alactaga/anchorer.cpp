 Briggs-Chase Law of Program Development:
	To de how long it will take to write and debug a
	program, take your best estimate, multiply that by two, add
	one, and convert to the next higher units.
	One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiastic
is our suppt f UNIX?
	Unix was written on our machines and f our machines many years ago.
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of our
VAXs are going f UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,
easy to get started with. It's gr f students, gr f somewhat casual
users, and it's gr f interchanging programs between different machines.
And so, because of its popularity in these s, we suppt it.  We have
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run
out of things they can do with UNIX. y'll want a real system and will end
up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
	With UNIX, if you're looking f something, you can easily and quickly
c that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no m
what you look f -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of docntation -- if
you look long enough it's there.  That's the difference -- the beauty of UNIX
is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.

	 growth-decay fmulas were developed in the trivial fashion by
Isaac Newton's famous brother Phigg.  His idea was to provide an equation
that would describe a quantity that would ddle and ddle, but never
quite reach zero.  Histically, he was merely trying to wk out his
mtgage.  Another versatile equation also emerged, one which would define
a function that would continue to grow, but never reach unity.  This equation
can be applied to charging capacits, over-damped springs, and the human
race in general.

	discuss details  talk about what it does at night  on weekends."
   (10) Displays a change of mood  physical reaction when near certain
	high-tech hardware.  "An alien may experience a mood change when

While it cannot be proved retrospectively that any experience of possession,
conversion, revelation,  divine ecstasy was merely an epileptic discharge,
we must ask how one differentiates "real transcendence" from neuropathies
that produce the same  realness, profundity, ineffability, and sense
of cosmic unity.  When accounts of sudden religious conversions in TLEs
[tempal-lobe epileptics] are laid alongside the epiphanous revelations of
the religious tradition, the parallels are striking.   same is true of the
recent spate of alleged UFO abductees.  Parsimony alone argues against invoking
spirits, demons,  extraterrestrials when natural causes will suffice.
