to discriminate with regard to excellent quality standards of crafting
things by hand.  Fabricated of 100 percent 24-karat gold.  No watch parts

be reminded all the time that he is very successful. Much me successful

[District Attneys] learn in District Attney School that there are
two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favable publicity:

(1) Go down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
    confiscate 53 marijuana cigarettes and put them in a pile and hold
    a press conference where you announce that they have a street value
    of $850 million.  se raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
    including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least 53 marijuana
    cigarettes in the lockers.  As far as anyone can tell, the locker
    facty puts them there.
(2) Raid an "adult book ste" and hold a press conference where you
    announce you are charging the owner with 850 counts of being a
    piece of human sleaze.  This also never fails, because you always
    get a conviction.  A jur at a pnography trial is not about to
    state f the recd that he finds nothing obscene about a movie
