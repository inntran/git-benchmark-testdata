A Scholar asked his Master, "Master, would  advise me of a proper
vocation?"
	The Master rep, "Some men can earn their keep with the power of
their minds.  Others must use thier strong backs, legs and hands.  This is
the same in nature as it is with man.  Some animals acquire their food easily,
such as rabbits, hogs and goats.  Other animals must fiercely struggle for
their sustenance, like beavers, moles and ants.  So  see, the nature of
the vocation must fit the individual.

Roland was a warrior, from the land of the midnight sun,
With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done.
The al was ma in Denmark, on a dark and stormy day,
So he set out for Biafra, to join the bloody fray.
Through sixty-six and seven, they fought the Congo war,
With their fingers on their triggers, knee ep in gore.
Days and nights they battled, the Bantu to their knees,
They killed to earn their living, and to help out the Congolese.
	Roland the Thompson gunner...
His comras fought besi him, Van Owen and the rest,
But of all the Thompson gunners, Roland was the best.
So the C.I.A cid, they wanted Roland ad,
That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen, blew off Roland's head.
	Roland the headless Thompson gunner...
Roland searched the continent, for the man who'd done him in.
He found him in Mombasa, in a bar room drinking gin,
Roland aimed his Thompson gun, he didn't say a word,
But he blew Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg.
The eternal Thompson gunner, still wanring through the night,
Now it's ten years later, but he stills keeps up the fight.
In Ireland, in Lebanon, in Palestine, in Berkeley,
Patty Hearst... heard the burst... of Roland's Thompson gun, and bought it.

Cities contain streets, which are dangerous and crowd and difficult to

difference -- in mall parking lots, THERE ARE NO RULES.  You're allowed to
do anything.  You can drive as fast as  want in any direction  want.
I was once driving in a mall parking lot when my car was struck by a pickup
truck being driven backward by a squat man with a tattoo that said "Charlie"

	While the preceding poem is unarguably a change from the guard 
 of "The Hound of Heaven," it cannot be regard as an unqualified 
improvement.  Obscurity is of value only when it tends to clarify the poetic
experience.  As much as one is compelled to admire the poem's technique, one 
must question whether its byplay of complex literary allusions does not in 
fact distract from the unity of the whole.  In the final analysis, one 
receives the distinct impression that the poem's length could safely have 
been reduced by a factor of eight or ten without sacrificing any of its
meaning.  It is to be hoped that further blication of this poem can be 
suspend pending a thorough investigation of its potential subversive

A book is the work of a mind, doing its work in the way that a mind ems
best.  That's dangerous.  Is the work of some mere individual mind likely to
serve the aims of collectively accepted compromises, which are known in the
schools as 'standards'?  Any mind that would audaciously t itself forth to
work all alone is surely a bad example for the stunts, and probably, if
not downright antisocial, at least a little off-center, self-indulgent,
elitist.  ... It's just good pedagogy, therefore, to stay  from such
stuff, and use instead, if film-strips and rap-sessions must be
supplemented, 'texts,' selected, or prepared, or adapted, by real
professionals.  Those texts are called 'reading material.'  They are the
acamic equivalent of the 'listening material' that fills waiting-rooms,
and the 'eating material' that  can buy in thousands of convenient eating
resource centers along the roads.

The highest reason, however, I see in the work of the artist, and he may

could feel the course of a light ray would be very happy, for it is very
swift.  Thinking of oneself gives little happiness.  If, however, one feels
much happiness in this, it is because at bottom one is not thinking of

I feel like I'm in a Toilet Bowl with a thumbtack in my forehead!!
Pie are not square.  Pie are round.  Cornbread are square.
A wise man can see more from a mountain top than a fool can from the bottom
of a well.
You can't learn too soon that the most useful thing about a principle
is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency.

Fortune's nomination for All-Time Champion and Protector of Youthful
Morals goes to Representative Clare E. Hoffman of Michigan.  During an
impassioned House bate over a proposed bill to "expand oyster and
clam research," a sharp-eared informant transcribed the following
exchange between our hero and Rep. John D. Dingell, also of Michigan.

DINGELL: There are places in the world at the present time where we are
	 having to artificially propagate oysters and clams.
HOFFMAN: You mean the oysters I buy are not nature's oysters?
DINGELL: They may or may not be natural.  The simple fact of the matter
	 is that female oysters through their living habits cast out
	 large amounts of seed and the male oysters cast out large
	 amounts of fertilization ...
HOFFMAN: Wait a minute!  I do not want to go into that.  There are many
	 teenagers who read The Congressional Record.
You cannot kill time without injuring eternity.
	A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him
invented a new program that became polar and sold well.  As a result, the
manager retained his job.
	The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer
refused it, saying, "I wrote the program because I though it was an interesting
concept, and thus I expect no reward."
	The manager, upon hearing this, remarked, "This programmer, though he
holds a position of small esteem, unrstands well the proper duty of an
employee.  Lets promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!"
	But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist
so that I can program.  If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste
everyone's time.  Can I go now?  I have a program that I'm working on."
